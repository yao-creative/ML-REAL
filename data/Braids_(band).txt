=== 2006–2008: formation and set pieces ===
braids grew out of friendships in calgary, where the band members were students at western canada high school. standell-preston recounted that it was a conversation over a blueberry muffin in the school's cafeteria that prompted the group's formation, under the name the neighbourhood council. rehearsing in smith's parents' garage, the band had early success backing lead vocalist standell-preston in a songwriting contest hosted by the calgary folk music festival. this led to an invitation to play at the inaugural sled island music festival in 2007. following their performance at sled island, the band continued to collaborate and opted to postpone attending university to play music.
after a year of intensive rehearsal and the departure of man, the band recorded their first ep, set pieces, at cjsw in april 2008. following the ep's release in july 2008, the band returned to sled island to play an opening set for deerhunter. their performance was highly regarded by the audience, who gave the group a standing ovation after deerhunter's bradford cox rose from his seat at the end of the group's set and requested that the band play an encore. this performance at sled island and the set pieces ep garnered more extensive attention for the band, including a notable mention from the music blog stereogum.


=== 2008–2011: relocation and native speaker ===
in september 2008, the band relocated to montreal, where lee, smith and tufts attended classes at mcgill university. in montreal, the band rehearsed new material for an album and changed their name from the neighbourhood council to braids (the ep was reissued under the braids name). tufts branded the original name as "pretty terrible" and felt the change reflected the band's "interwoven and interlaced" style. the band continued to develop material and their particular sound. work from this period was debuted on a series of short tours, including a brief reunion with deerhunter. with the structure of the group's music largely established, the band began to record and self-produce their debut album, native speaker, in july 2009. with only the drum tracks laid out for the album, the band embarked on their first major tour across canada a month later.work resumed on native speaker when the group returned to montreal in september 2009. the band completed recording the album during the winter of 2010. during this period, braids was invited to play a set at pop montreal and recorded a video with vincent moon for a series on montreal bands. later in 2010, braids toured in support of holly miranda in canada and the united states. after negotiating with labels in the united states and canada, braids announced chad vangaalen's label flemish eye would distribute native speaker in canada and kanine records would release the album in the united states, with the release date set for january 18, 2011.

native speaker has received mostly positive reviews from critics, with the group's percussive sound likened to feels-era animal collective and praised for its innovative melodies and standell-preston's "dynamic" vocals. robert everett-green of the globe and mail gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, declaring that he could not stop listening to the record and comparing the importance of the group's debut to early broken social scene and arcade fire. the group also garnered positive reviews from jon pareles of the new york times who said that the music is as "mesmerizing and vertiginous as desire can be", while paul lester remarked in the guardian that the band's "experimental dream pop delivered through a shoegaze haze" warrants comparisons to "very important bands". reviews from spin, rolling stone and pitchfork were also positive, with the publications rating the record 8 out of 10, 7.9 out of 10 and 3.5 out of 5 stars, respectively.on june 16, the album was named as a longlisted nominee (one of 40) for the 2011 polaris music prize. on july 6, the album was named as a shortlisted (one of 10) nominee for the 2011 award. the polaris music prize is an award presented on an annual basis to the creators of a full-length canadian album, based solely on artistic merit without regard to genre or records sales. the album was nominated in two categories during the 2012 juno awards.
