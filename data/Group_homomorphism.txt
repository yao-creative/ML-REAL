in mathematics, given two groups, (g, ∗) and (h, ·), a group homomorphism from (g, ∗) to (h, ·) is a function h : g → h such that for all u and v in g it holds that

  
    
      
        h
        (
        u
        ∗
        v
        )
        =
        h
        (
        u
        )
        ⋅
        h
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(u*v)=h(u)\cdot h(v)}
  where the group operation on the left side of the equation is that of g and on the right side that of h.
from this property, one can deduce that h maps the identity element eg of g to the identity element eh of h,

  
    
      
        h
        (
        
          e
          
            g
          
        
        )
        =
        
          e
          
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(e_{g})=e_{h}}
  and it also maps inverses to inverses in the sense that 

  
    
      
        h
        
          (
          
            u
            
              −
              1
            
          
          )
        
        =
        h
        (
        u
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h\left(u^{-1}\right)=h(u)^{-1}.\,}
  hence one can say that h "is compatible with the group structure".
older notations for the homomorphism h(x) may be xh or xh, though this may be confused as an index or a general subscript.  in automata theory, sometimes homomorphisms are written to the right of their arguments without parentheses, so that h(x) becomes simply x h.in areas of mathematics where one considers groups endowed with additional structure, a homomorphism sometimes means a map which respects not only the group structure (as above) but also the extra structure. for example, a homomorphism of topological groups is often required to be continuous.


== intuition ==
the purpose of defining a group homomorphism is to create functions that preserve the algebraic structure. an equivalent definition of group homomorphism is: the function h : g → h is a group homomorphism if whenever 

a ∗ b = c   we have   h(a) ⋅ h(b) = h(c).in other words, the group h in some sense has a similar algebraic structure as g and the homomorphism h preserves that.


== types ==
monomorphism
a group homomorphism that is injective (or, one-to-one); i.e., preserves distinctness.
epimorphism
a group homomorphism that is surjective (or, onto); i.e., reaches every point in the codomain.
isomorphism
a group homomorphism that is bijective; i.e., injective and surjective. its inverse is also a group homomorphism. in this case, the groups g and h are called isomorphic; they differ only in the notation of their elements and are identical for all practical purposes.
endomorphism
a group homomorphism, h: g → g; the domain and codomain are the same. also called an endomorphism of g.
automorphism
a group endomorphism that is bijective, and hence an isomorphism. the set of all automorphisms of a group g, with functional composition as operation, forms itself a group, the automorphism group of g. it is denoted by aut(g). as an example, the automorphism group of (z, +) contains only two elements, the identity transformation and multiplication with −1; it is isomorphic to z/2z.


== image and kernel ==

we define the kernel of h to be the set of elements in g which are mapped to the identity in h

  
    
      
        ker
        ⁡
        (
        h
        )
        ≡
        
          {
          
            u
            ∈
            g
            :
            h
            (
            u
            )
            =
            
              e
              
                h
              
            
          
          }
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ker} (h)\equiv \left\{u\in g\colon h(u)=e_{h}\right\}.}
  and the image  of h to be

  
    
      
        im
        ⁡
        (
        h
        )
        ≡
        h
        (
        g
        )
        ≡
        
          {
          
            h
            (
            u
            )
            :
            u
            ∈
            g
          
          }
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {im} (h)\equiv h(g)\equiv \left\{h(u)\colon u\in g\right\}.}
  the kernel and image of a homomorphism can be interpreted as measuring how close it is to being an isomorphism. the first isomorphism theorem states that the image of a group homomorphism, h(g) is isomorphic to the quotient group g/ker h.
the kernel of h is a normal subgroup of g  and the image of h is a subgroup of h:

  if and only if ker(h) = {eg}, the homomorphism, h, is a group monomorphism; i.e., h is injective (one-to-one). injection directly gives that there is a unique element in the kernel, and a unique element in the kernel gives injection:

consider the cyclic group z/3z = {0, 1, 2} and the group of integers z with addition. the map h : z → z/3z with h(u) = u mod 3 is a group homomorphism. it is surjective and its kernel consists of all integers which are divisible by 3.
the exponential map yields a group homomorphism from the group of real numbers r with addition to the group of non-zero real numbers r* with multiplication. the kernel is {0} and the image consists of the positive real numbers.
the exponential map also yields a group homomorphism from the group of complex numbers c with addition to the group of non-zero complex numbers c* with multiplication. this map is surjective and has the kernel {2πki : k ∈ z}, as can be seen from euler's formula.  fields like r and c that have homomorphisms from their additive group to their multiplicative group are thus called exponential fields.


== the category of groups ==
if h : g → h and k : h → k are group homomorphisms, then so is k ∘ h : g → k. this shows that the class of all groups, together with group homomorphisms as morphisms, forms a category.


== homomorphisms of abelian groups ==
if g and h are abelian (i.e., commutative) groups, then the set hom(g, h) of all group homomorphisms from g to h is itself an abelian group: the sum h + k of two homomorphisms is defined by

(h + k)(u) = h(u) + k(u)    for all u in g.the commutativity of h is needed to prove that h + k is again a group homomorphism.
the addition of homomorphisms is compatible with the composition of homomorphisms in the following sense: if f is in hom(k, g), h, k are elements of hom(g, h), and g is in hom(h, l), then 

(h + k) ∘ f  =  (h ∘ f) + (k ∘ f)    and    g ∘ (h + k)  = (g ∘ h) + (g ∘ k).since the composition is associative, this shows that the set end(g) of all endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a ring, the endomorphism ring of g. for example, the endomorphism ring of the abelian group consisting of the direct sum of m copies of z/nz is isomorphic to the ring of m-by-m matrices with entries in z/nz. the above compatibility also shows that the category of all abelian groups with group homomorphisms forms a preadditive category; the existence of direct sums and well-behaved kernels makes this category the prototypical example of an abelian category.
