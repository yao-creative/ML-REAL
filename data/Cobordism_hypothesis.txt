in mathematics, the cobordism hypothesis, due to john c. baez and james dolan, concerns the classification of extended topological quantum field theories (tqfts). in 2008, jacob lurie proposed a broadly-accepted solution. in 2021 a geometric version has been formulated by daniel grady and dmitri pavlov

== motivation ==
symmetric monoidal functors from the cobordism category correspond to topological quantum field theories. the cobordism hypothesis for topological quantum field theories is the analogue of the eilenberg-steenrod axioms for homology theories. the eilenberg-steenrod axioms state that a homology theory is uniquely determined by its value for the point, so analogously what the cobordism hypothesis states is that a topological quantum field theory is uniquely determined by its value for the point. in other words, the bijection between

            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {c}}}
   is uniquely defined by its value for the point.
