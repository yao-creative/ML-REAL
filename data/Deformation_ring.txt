in mathematics, a deformation ring is a ring that controls liftings of a representation of a galois group from a finite field to a local field. in particular for any such lifting problem there is often a universal deformation ring that classifies all such liftings, and whose spectrum is the universal deformation space.
a key step in wiles's proof of the modularity theorem was to study the relation between universal deformation rings and hecke algebras.
