in mathematics, a functional calculus is a theory allowing one to apply mathematical functions to mathematical operators. it is now a branch (more accurately, several related areas) of the field of functional analysis, connected with spectral theory. (historically, the term was also used synonymously with calculus of variations; this usage is obsolete, except for functional derivative. sometimes it is used in relation to types of functional equations, or in logic for systems of predicate calculus.)
if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a function, say a numerical function of a real number, and 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is an operator, there is no particular reason why the expression 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(m)}
   should make sense. if it does, then we are no longer using 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   on its original function domain. in the tradition of operational calculus, algebraic expressions in operators are handled irrespective of their meaning.  this passes nearly unnoticed if we talk about 'squaring a matrix', though, which is the case of 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}}
   and 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   an 
  
    
      
        n
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\times n}
   matrix. the idea of a functional calculus is to create a principled approach to this kind of overloading of the notation. 
the most immediate case is to apply polynomial functions to a square matrix, extending what has just been discussed. in the finite-dimensional case, the polynomial functional calculus yields quite a bit of information about the operator. for example, consider the family of polynomials which annihilates an operator 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  . this family is an ideal in the ring of polynomials. furthermore, it is a nontrivial ideal: let 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   be the finite dimension of the algebra of matrices, then 
  
    
      
        {
        i
        ,
        t
        ,
        
          t
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          t
          
            n
          
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{i,t,t^{2},\ldots ,t^{n}\}}
   is linearly dependent. so 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            0
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
        
          t
          
            i
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{n}\alpha _{i}t^{i}=0}
   for some scalars 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}
  , not all equal to 0. this implies that the polynomial 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            0
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{n}\alpha _{i}x^{i}}
   lies in the ideal. since the ring of polynomials is a principal ideal domain, this ideal is generated by some polynomial 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  . multiplying by a unit if necessary, we can choose 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   to be monic. when this is done, the polynomial 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is precisely the minimal polynomial of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  . this polynomial gives deep information about 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  . for instance, a scalar 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is an eigenvalue of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is a root of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  . also, sometimes 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   can be used to calculate the exponential of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   efficiently. 
the polynomial calculus is not as informative in the infinite-dimensional case. consider the unilateral shift with the polynomials calculus; the ideal defined above is now trivial. thus one is interested in functional calculi more general than polynomials. the subject is closely linked to spectral theory, since for a diagonal matrix or multiplication operator, it is rather clear what the definitions should be.
