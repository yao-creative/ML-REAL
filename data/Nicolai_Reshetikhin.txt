nicolai yuryevich reshetikhin (russian: николай юрьевич решетихин, born october 10, 1958 in leningrad, soviet union) is a mathematical physicist, currently a professor of mathematics at the university of california, berkeley and a professor of mathematical physics at the university of amsterdam (korteweg-de vries institute for mathematics). his research is in the fields of low-dimensional topology, representation theory, and quantum groups. his major contributions are in the theory of quantum integrable systems, in representation theory of quantum groups
and in quantum topology.  he and vladimir turaev constructed invariants of 3-manifolds
which are expected to describe quantum chern-simons field theory introduced by edward witten.
he earned his bachelor's degree and master's degree from leningrad state university in 1982, and his ph.d. from the steklov mathematical institute in 1984.
he gave a plenary lecture at the international congress of mathematicians in 2010. he was named a fellow of the american mathematical society, in the 2022 class of fellows, "for contributions to the theory of quantum groups, integrable systems, topology, and quantum physics".
