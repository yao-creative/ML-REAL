in quantum geometry or noncommutative geometry a quantum differential calculus or noncommutative differential structure on an algebra 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   over a field 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   means the specification of a space of differential forms over the algebra.  the algebra 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   here is regarded as a coordinate ring but it is important that it may be noncommutative and hence not an actual algebra of coordinate functions on any actual space, so this represents a point of view replacing the specification of a differentiable structure for an actual space. in ordinary differential geometry one can multiply differential 1-forms by functions from the left and from the right, and there exists an exterior derivative.  correspondingly, a first order quantum differential calculus means at least the following:

the last condition is not always imposed but holds in ordinary geometry when the manifold is connected. it says that the only functions killed by 
  
    
      
        
          
            d

   are constant functions.
an exterior algebra or differential graded algebra structure over

   means a compatible extension of

    {\displaystyle \omega =\oplus _{n}\omega ^{n},\ {\rm {d}}:\omega ^{n}\to \omega ^{n+1}}
  obeying a graded-leibniz rule with respect to an associative product on 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   and obeying 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d

        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\rm {d}}^{2}=0}
  . here 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            0
          
        
        =
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega ^{0}=a}
   and it is usually required that 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   is generated by 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,\omega ^{1}}
  . the product of differential forms is called the exterior or wedge product and often denoted 
  
    
      
        ∧
      
    
    {\displaystyle \wedge }
  . the noncommutative or quantum de rham cohomology is defined as the cohomology of this complex.
a higher order differential calculus can mean an exterior algebra, or it can mean the partial specification of one, up to some highest degree, and with products that would result in a degree beyond the highest being unspecified.
the above definition lies at the crossroads of two approaches to noncommutative geometry. in the connes approach a more fundamental object is a replacement for the dirac operator in the form of a spectral triple, and an exterior algebra can be constructed from this data. in the quantum groups approach to noncommutative geometry one starts with the algebra and a choice of first order calculus but constrained by covariance under a quantum group symmetry.


== note ==
the above definition is minimal and gives something more general than classical differential calculus even when the algebra 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is commutative or functions on an actual space. this is because we do not demand that

  
    
      
        a
        (
        
          
            d
          
        
        b
        )
        =
        (
        
          
            d
          
        
        b
        )
        a
        ,
         
        ∀
        a
        ,
        b
        ∈
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a({\rm {d}}b)=({\rm {d}}b)a,\ \forall a,b\in a}
  since this would imply that 
  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
        
        (
        a
        b
        −
        b
        a
        )
        =
        0
        ,
         
        ∀
        a
        ,
        b
        ∈
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\rm {d}}(ab-ba)=0,\ \forall a,b\in a}
  , which would violate axiom 4 when the algebra was noncommutative. as a byproduct, this enlarged definition includes finite difference calculi and quantum differential calculi on finite sets and finite groups (finite group lie algebra theory).
