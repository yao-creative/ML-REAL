independence is a fundamental notion in probability theory, as in statistics and the theory of stochastic processes.
two events are independent, statistically independent, or stochastically independent if, informally speaking, the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other (equivalently, does not affect the odds). similarly, two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other.
when dealing with collections of more than two events, two notions of independence need to be distinguished. the events are called pairwise independent if any two events in the collection are independent of each other, while mutual independence (or collective independence)  of events means, informally speaking, that each event is independent of any combination of other events in the collection. a similar notion exists for collections of random variables. mutual independence implies pairwise independence, but not the other way around. in the standard literature of probability theory, statistics, and stochastic processes, independence without further qualification usually refers to mutual independence.

==== two events ====
two events 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   are independent (often written as 
  
    
      
        a
        ⊥
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\perp b}
   or 
  
    
      
        a
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\perp \!\!\!\perp b}
  ) iff (if and only if) their joint probability equals the product of their probabilities:: p. 29 : p. 10 

it indicates that two independent events 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   have common elements in their sample space so that they are not mutually exclusive (mutually exclusive iff 
  
    
      
        a
        ∩
        b
        =
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\cap b=\emptyset }
  ). why this defines independence is made clear by rewriting with conditional probabilities 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        a
        ∣
        b

        =
        
          
            
              p

              a
              ∩
              b
              )

    {\displaystyle p(a\mid b)={\frac {p(a\cap b)}{p(b)}}}
   as the probability at which the event 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   occurs provided that the event 
  
    
      
        b

                p

        =

  and similarly

  
    
      
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        ∩
        b
        )
        =
        
          p
        
        (

        )
        
          p
        
        (

        )
        
        ⟺

        (
        b
        ∣
        a
        )
        =
        
          
            
              
                p
              
              (
              a
              ∩
              b
              )
            
            
              
                p
              
              (
              a
              )
            
          
        
        =
        
          p

    {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} (a\cap b)=\mathrm {p} (a)\mathrm {p} (b)\iff \mathrm {p} (b\mid a)={\frac {\mathrm {p} (a\cap b)}{\mathrm {p} (a)}}=\mathrm {p} (b).}
  thus, the occurrence of 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   does not affect the probability of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  , and vice versa. in other words, 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   are independent to each other. although the derived expressions may seem more intuitive, they are not the preferred definition, as the conditional probabilities may be undefined if 
  
    
      
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} (a)}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          p
        
        (
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} (b)}
   are 0. furthermore, the preferred definition makes clear by symmetry that when 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is independent of 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  , 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   is also independent of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  .


==== log probability and information content ====
stated in terms of log probability, two events are independent if and only if the log probability of the joint event is the sum of the log probability of the individual events:

  
    
      
        log
        ⁡
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        ∩
        b
        )
        =
        log
        ⁡
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        )
        +
        log
        ⁡
        
          p
        
        (
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \log \mathrm {p} (a\cap b)=\log \mathrm {p} (a)+\log \mathrm {p} (b)}
  in information theory, negative log probability is interpreted as information content, and thus two events are independent if and only if the information content of the combined event equals the sum of information content of the individual events:

  
    
      
        
          i
        
        (
        a
        ∩
        b
        )
        =
        
          i
        
        (
        a
        )
        +
        
          i
        
        (
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {i} (a\cap b)=\mathrm {i} (a)+\mathrm {i} (b)}
  see information content § additivity of independent events for details.


==== odds ====
stated in terms of odds, two events are independent if and only if the odds ratio of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   is unity (1). analogously with probability, this is equivalent to the conditional odds being equal to the unconditional odds:

  
    
      
        o
        (
        a
        ∣
        b
        )
        =
        o
        (
        a
        )
        
           and 
        
        o
        (
        b
        ∣
        a
        )
        =
        o
        (
        b
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle o(a\mid b)=o(a){\text{ and }}o(b\mid a)=o(b),}
  or to the odds of one event, given the other event, being the same as the odds of the event, given the other event not occurring:

  
    
      
        o
        (
        a
        ∣
        b
        )
        =
        o
        (
        a
        ∣
        ¬
        b
        )
        
           and 
        
        o
        (
        b
        ∣
        a
        )
        =
        o
        (
        b
        ∣
        ¬
        a
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle o(a\mid b)=o(a\mid \neg b){\text{ and }}o(b\mid a)=o(b\mid \neg a).}
  the odds ratio can be defined as

  
    
      
        o
        (
        a
        ∣
        b
        )
        :
        o
        (
        a
        ∣
        ¬
        b
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle o(a\mid b):o(a\mid \neg b),}
  or symmetrically for odds of 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   given 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  , and thus is 1 if and only if the events are independent.


==== more than two events ====
a finite set of events 
  
    
      
        {
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        
          }
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{a_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}}
   is pairwise independent if every pair of events is independent—that is, if and only if for all distinct pairs of indices 
  
    
      
        m
        ,
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle m,k}
  ,

a finite set of events is mutually independent if every event is independent of any intersection of the other events: p. 11 —that is, if and only if for every 
  
    
      
        k
        ≤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\leq n}
   and for every k indices 
  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        
          i
          
            1
          
        
        <
        ⋯
        <
        
          i
          
            k
          
        
        ≤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{1}<\dots <i_{k}\leq n}
  ,

this is called the multiplication rule for independent events. note that it is not a single condition involving only the product of all the probabilities of all single events; it must hold true for all subsets of events.
for more than two events, a mutually independent set of events is (by definition) pairwise independent; but the converse is not necessarily true.: p. 30

  and an infinite family of σ-algebras is said to be independent if all its finite subfamilies are independent.
the new definition relates to the previous ones very directly:

two events are independent (in the old sense) if and only if the σ-algebras that they generate are independent (in the new sense).  the σ-algebra generated by an event 
  
    
      
        e
        ∈
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle e\in \sigma }
   is, by definition,
  
    
      
        σ
        (
        {
        e
        }
        )
        =
        {
        ∅
        ,
        e
        ,
        ω

    {\displaystyle \sigma (\{e\})=\{\emptyset ,e,\omega \setminus e,\omega \}.}
  two random variables 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   defined over 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   are independent (in the old sense) if and only if the σ-algebras that they generate are independent (in the new sense).  the σ-algebra generated by a random variable 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   taking values in some measurable space 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   consists, by definition, of all subsets of 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   of the form 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{-1}(u)}
  , where 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is any measurable subset of 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  .using this definition, it is easy to show that if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are random variables and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   is constant, then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are independent, since the σ-algebra generated by a constant random variable is the trivial σ-algebra 
  
    
      
        {
        ∅
        ,
        ω
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\varnothing ,\omega \}}
  . probability zero events cannot affect independence so independence also holds if 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   is only pr-almost surely constant.


== properties ==


=== self-independence ===
note that an event is independent of itself if and only if

  
    
      
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        )
        =
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        ∩
        a
        )
        =
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        )
        ⋅
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        )
        
        ⟺
        
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        )
        =
        0
        
           or 
        
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        )
        =
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} (a)=\mathrm {p} (a\cap a)=\mathrm {p} (a)\cdot \mathrm {p} (a)\iff \mathrm {p} (a)=0{\text{ or }}\mathrm {p} (a)=1.}
  thus an event is independent of itself if and only if it almost surely occurs or its complement almost surely occurs; this fact is useful when proving zero–one laws.


=== expectation and covariance ===

if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are independent random variables, then the expectation operator 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {e} }
   has the property

  
    
      
        e
        ⁡
        [
        x
        y
        ]
        =
        e
        ⁡
        [
        x
        ]
        e
        ⁡
        [
        y
        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {e} [xy]=\operatorname {e} [x]\operatorname {e} [y],}
  and the covariance 
  
    
      
        cov
        ⁡
        [
        x
        ,
        y
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {cov} [x,y]}
   is zero, as follows from

  
    
      
        cov
        ⁡
        [
        x
        ,
        y
        ]
        =
        e
        ⁡
        [
        x
        y
        ]
        −
        e
        ⁡
        [
        x
        ]
        e
        ⁡
        [
        y
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {cov} [x,y]=\operatorname {e} [xy]-\operatorname {e} [x]\operatorname {e} [y].}
  the converse does not hold: if two random variables have a covariance of 0 they still may be not independent.  see uncorrelated.
similarly for two stochastic processes 
  
    
      
        
          
            {

                t
              
            
            }

                t
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{x_{t}\right\}_{t\in {\mathcal {t}}}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            {
            
              y
              
                t
              
            
            }
          
          
            t
            ∈
            
              
                t
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{y_{t}\right\}_{t\in {\mathcal {t}}}}

=== characteristic function ===
two random variables 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are independent if and only if the characteristic function of the random vector 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y)}
   satisfies

  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            (
            x
            ,
            y
            )
          
        
        (
        t
        ,
        s
        )
        =
        
          φ
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        ⋅
        
          φ
          
            y
          
        
        (
        s
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{(x,y)}(t,s)=\varphi _{x}(t)\cdot \varphi _{y}(s).}
  in particular the characteristic function of their sum is the product of their marginal characteristic functions:

  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            x
            +
            y
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          φ
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        ⋅
        
          φ
          
            y
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{x+y}(t)=\varphi _{x}(t)\cdot \varphi _{y}(t),}
  though the reverse implication is not true.  random variables that satisfy the latter condition are called subindependent.


== examples ==


=== rolling dice ===
the event of getting a 6 the first time a die is rolled and the event of getting a 6 the second time are independent. by contrast, the event of getting a 6 the first time a die is rolled and the event that the sum of the numbers seen on the first and second trial is 8 are not independent.


=== drawing cards ===
if two cards are drawn with replacement from a deck of cards, the event of drawing a red card on the first trial and that of drawing a red card on the second trial are independent. by contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck of cards, the event of drawing a red card on the first trial and that of drawing a red card on the second trial are  not independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.


=== pairwise and mutual independence ===

=== mutual but not pairwise independence ===
it is possible to create a three-event example in which

  
    
      
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        ∩
        b
        ∩
        c
        )
        =
        
          p
        
        (
        a
        )
        
          p
        
        (
        b
        )
        
          p
        
        (
        c
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} (a\cap b\cap c)=\mathrm {p} (a)\mathrm {p} (b)\mathrm {p} (c),}
  and yet no two of the three events are pairwise independent (and hence the set of events are not mutually independent). this example shows that mutual independence involves requirements on the products of probabilities of all combinations of events, not just the single events as in this example.

    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   are conditionally independent given an event 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   when

  
    
      
        
          p
        
        (
        a

=== for random variables ===
intuitively, two random variables 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are conditionally independent given 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   if, once 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   is known, the value of 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   does not add any additional information about 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .  for instance, two measurements 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   of the same underlying quantity 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   are not independent, but they are conditionally independent given 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   (unless the errors in the two measurements are somehow connected).
the formal definition of conditional independence is based on the idea of conditional distributions.  if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
  , and 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   are discrete random variables, then we define 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and

        z

independence can be seen as a special kind of conditional independence, since probability can be seen as a kind of conditional probability given no events.
