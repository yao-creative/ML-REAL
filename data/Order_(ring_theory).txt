in mathematics, an order in the sense of ring theory is a subring 
  
    
      
        
          
            o
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}}
   of a ring 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  , such that

  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is a finite-dimensional algebra over the field 
  
    
      
        
          q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {q} }
   of rational numbers

  
    
      
        
          
            o
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}}
   spans 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   over 
  
    
      
        
          q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {q} }
  , and

  
    
      
        
          
            o
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}}
   is a 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} }
  -lattice in 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  .the last two conditions can be stated in less formal terms:  additively, 
  
    
      
        
          
            o
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}}
   is a free abelian group generated by a basis for 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   over 
  
    
      
        
          q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {q} }
  .
more generally for 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
   an integral domain contained in a field 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  , we define 
  
    
      
        
          
            o
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}}
   to be an 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}

        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -algebra 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   if it is a subring of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   which is a full 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  -lattice.when 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is not a commutative ring, the idea of order is still important, but the phenomena are different. for example, the hurwitz quaternions form a maximal order in the quaternions with rational co-ordinates; they are not the quaternions with integer coordinates in the most obvious sense. maximal orders exist in general, but need not be unique: there is in general no largest order, but a number of maximal orders. an important class of examples is that of integral group rings.

  a fundamental property of 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  -orders is that every element of an 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  -order is integral over

        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   need not even be a ring, and even if 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is a ring (for example, when 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is commutative) then 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   need not be an 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  -lattice.


== algebraic number theory ==
the leading example is the case where 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is a number field 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            o
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}}
   is its ring of integers. in algebraic number theory there are examples for any 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   other than the rational field of proper subrings of the ring of integers that are also orders. for example, in the field extension 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        
          q
        
        (
        i
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=\mathbb {q} (i)}
   of gaussian rationals over 
  
    
      
        
          q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {q} }
  , the integral closure of 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} }
    is the ring of gaussian integers 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
        [
        i
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} [i]}
   and so this is the unique maximal 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} }
  -order: all other orders in 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   are contained in it. for example, we can take the subring of complex numbers of the form 
  
    
      
        a
        +
        2
        b
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle a+2bi}
  , with 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   integers.the maximal order question can be examined at a local field level. this technique is applied in algebraic number theory and modular representation theory.
