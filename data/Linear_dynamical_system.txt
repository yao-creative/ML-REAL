linear dynamical systems are dynamical systems whose evaluation functions are linear.  while dynamical systems, in general, do not have closed-form solutions, linear dynamical systems can be solved exactly, and they have a rich set of mathematical properties.  linear systems can also be used to understand the qualitative behavior of general dynamical systems, by calculating the equilibrium points of the system and approximating it as a linear system around each such point.

in a linear dynamical system, the variation of a state vector 
(an

          x
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
  ) equals a constant matrix
(denoted 
  
    
      
        
          a

          x
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }

as a flow, in which

        (

   and 
  
    
      
        β

          a
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }

linear dynamical systems can be solved exactly, in contrast to most nonlinear ones.  occasionally, a nonlinear system can be  solved exactly by a change of variables to a linear system.  moreover, the solutions of (almost) any nonlinear system can be well-approximated by an equivalent linear system near its fixed points.  hence, understanding linear systems and their solutions is a crucial first step to understanding the more complex nonlinear systems.

    {\displaystyle \delta =\lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}}
   and 
  
    
      
        τ
        =
        
          λ

    {\displaystyle \tau =\lambda _{1}+\lambda _{2}}
  .  thus if 
  
    
      
        δ
        <
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta <0}
   then the eigenvalues are of opposite sign, and the fixed point is a saddle.  if 
  
    
      
        δ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta >0}
   then the eigenvalues are of the same sign.  therefore, if 
  
    
      
        τ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau >0}
   both are positive and the point is unstable, and if 
  
    
      
        τ
        <
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau <0}
   then both are negative and the point is stable.  the discriminant will tell you if the point is nodal or spiral (i.e. if the eigenvalues are real or complex).
