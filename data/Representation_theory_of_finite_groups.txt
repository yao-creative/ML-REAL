the representation theory of groups is a part of mathematics which examines how groups act on given structures.
here the focus is in particular on operations of groups on vector spaces. nevertheless, groups acting on other groups or on sets are also considered. for more details, please refer to the section on permutation representations.
other than a few marked exceptions, only finite groups will be considered in this article. we will also restrict ourselves to vector spaces over fields of characteristic zero. because the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero is complete, a theory valid for a special algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is also valid for every other algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. thus, without loss of generality, we can study vector spaces over 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} .}
  
representation theory is used in many parts of mathematics, as well as in quantum chemistry and physics. among other things it is used in algebra to examine the structure of groups. there are also applications in harmonic analysis and number theory. for example, representation theory is used in the modern approach to gain new results about automorphic forms.

   often the term representation of

the representation of a group in a module instead of a vector space is also called a linear representation.
we write 
  
    
      
        (
        ρ
        ,
        
          v

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\rho ,v_{\rho })}
   for the representation 
  
    
      
        ρ
        :
        g
        →
        
          gl

        g

   sometimes we use the notation 
  
    
      
        (
        ρ
        ,
        v
        )

        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   belongs.
in this article we will restrict ourselves to the study of finite-dimensional representation spaces, except for the last chapter. as in most cases only a finite number of vectors in 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is of interest, it is sufficient to study the subrepresentation generated by these vectors. the representation space of this subrepresentation is then finite-dimensional.
the degree of a representation is the dimension  of its representation space 
  
    
      
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle v.}
   the notation

        (
        ρ

    {\displaystyle \dim(\rho )}
   is sometimes used to denote the degree of a representation

   as every element of

        ρ
        :
        g
        =

   be a nontrivial linear representation. since 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is a group homomorphism, it has to satisfy 
  
    
      
        ρ
        (
        
          0

    {\displaystyle 1}
   generates 
  
    
      
        g

        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,\rho }

    {\displaystyle \rho ({1})\in \{i,-1,-i\}.}
   thus, we achieve the result that the image of

    {\displaystyle g}
   under 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   has to be a nontrivial subgroup of the group which consists of the fourth roots of unity. in other words, 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   has to be one of the following three maps:

a group acting on a finite set is sometimes considered sufficient for the definition of the permutation representation. however, since we want to construct examples for linear representations - where groups act on vector spaces instead of on arbitrary finite sets - we have to proceed in a different way. in order to construct the permutation representation, we need a vector space

   the degree of the left-regular representation is equal to the order of the group.
the right-regular representation is defined on the same vector space with a similar homomorphism:

both representations are isomorphic via

   for this reason they are not always set apart, and often referred to as "the" regular representation.

we define a map between

any representation v has at least two subrepresentations, namely the one consisting only of 0, and the one consisting of v itself. the representation is called an irreducible representation, if these two are the only subrepresentations. some authors also call these representations simple, given that they are precisely the simple modules over the group algebra

otherwise, if the two representations are not isomorphic, f must be 0.

a representation is called semisimple or completely reducible if it can be written as a direct sum of irreducible representations. this is analogous to the corresponding definition for a semisimple algebra.
for the definition of the direct sum of representations please refer to the section on direct sums of representations.
a representation is called isotypic if it is a direct sum of pairwise isomorphic irreducible representations.

== decompositions ==
in order to understand representations more easily, a decomposition of the representation space into the direct sum of simpler subrepresentations would be desirable.
this can be achieved for finite groups as we will see in the following results. more detailed explanations and proofs may be found in  [1] and  [2].

theorem. (maschke) let 
  
    
      
        ρ
        :
        g
        →
        
          gl
        
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho :g\to {\text{gl}}(v)}
   be a linear representation where 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is a vector space over a field of characteristic zero. let 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}
   be a 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -invariant subspace of 
  
    
      
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle v.}
   then the complement 
  
    
      
        
          w
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle w^{0}}
   of 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}
   exists in 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   and is 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -invariant.a subrepresentation and its complement determine a representation uniquely.
the following theorem will be presented in a more general way, as it provides a very beautiful result about representations of compact – and therefore also of finite – groups:

theorem. every linear representation of a compact group over a field of characteristic zero is a direct sum of irreducible representations.or in the language of 
  
    
      
        k
        [
        g
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle k[g]}
  -modules: if 
  
    
      
        
          char
        
        (
        k
        )
        =
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{char}}(k)=0,}
   the group algebra 
  
    
      
        k
        [
        g
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle k[g]}
   is semisimple, i.e. it is the direct sum of simple algebras.
note that this decomposition is not unique. however, the number of how many times a subrepresentation isomorphic to a given irreducible representation is occurring in this decomposition is independent of the choice of decomposition.
the canonical decomposition
to achieve a unique decomposition, one has to combine all the irreducible subrepresentations that are isomorphic to each other. that means, the representation space is decomposed into a direct sum of its isotypes. this decomposition is uniquely determined. it is called the canonical decomposition.

  proposition. the map

    {\displaystyle p}
   is a projection from

  this proposition enables us to determine the isotype to the trivial subrepresentation of a given representation explicitly.
how often the trivial representation occurs in 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is given by 
  
    
      
        
          tr
        
        (
        p
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{tr}}(p).}
   this result is a consequence of the fact that the eigenvalues of a projection are only 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
   or 
  
    
      
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1}
   and that the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 
  
    
      
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1}
   is the image of the projection. since the trace of the projection is the sum of all eigenvalues, we obtain the following result 

  
    
      
        dim
        ⁡
        (

    {\displaystyle \pi }
   is not. this is because (in terms of the inner product from ”inner product and characters” below) we have

  the theorems above are in general not valid for infinite groups. this will be demonstrated by the following example: let

        a

  together with the matrix multiplication 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is an infinite group.

    {\displaystyle a\in g.}
   the subspace 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        
          e
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} e_{1}}
   is a 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -invariant subspace. however, there exists no 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -invariant complement to this subspace. the assumption that such a complement exists would entail that every matrix is diagonalizable over 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} .}
   this is known to be wrong and thus yields a contradiction.
the moral of the story is that if we consider infinite groups, it is possible that a representation - even one that is not irreducible - can not be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations.

the character of a representation 
  
    
      
        ρ
        :
        g
        →
        
          gl
        
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho :g\to {\text{gl}}(v)}
   is defined as the map

  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            ρ
          
        
        :
        g
        →
        
          c
        
        ,
        
          χ
          
            ρ
          
        
        (
        s
        )
        :=
        
          tr
        
        (
        ρ
        (
        s
        )
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{\rho }:g\to \mathbb {c} ,\chi _{\rho }(s):={\text{tr}}(\rho (s)),}
   in which 
  
    
      
        
          tr
        
        (
        ρ
        (
        s
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{tr}}(\rho (s))}
   denotes the trace of the linear map 
  
    
      
        ρ
        (
        s
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho (s).}
  even though the character is a map between two groups, it is not in general a group homomorphism, as the following example shows.
let 
  
    
      
        ρ

          /
        
        2
        
          z
        
        →

  characters of permutation representations are particularly easy to compute. if v is the g-representation corresponding to the left action of

    {\displaystyle g}
   on a finite set

    {\displaystyle x}

  for example, the character of the regular representation

=== properties ===
a crucial property of characters is the formula

  
    
      
        χ
        (
        t
        s
        
          t
          
            −
            1
          
        
        )
        =
        χ
        (
        s
        )
        ,
        
        
        ∀
        
        s
        ,
        t
        ∈
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi (tst^{-1})=\chi (s),\,\,\forall \,s,t\in g.}
  this formula follows from the fact that the trace of a product ab of two square matrices is the same as the trace of ba. functions 
  
    
      
        g
        →
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\to \mathbb {c} }
   satisfying such a formula are called class functions. put differently, class functions and in particular characters are constant on each conjugacy class 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            s
          
        
        =
        {
        t
        s
        
          t
          
            −
            1
          
        
        
          |
        
        t
        ∈
        g
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{s}=\{tst^{-1}|t\in g\}.}
  
it also follows from elementary properties of the trace that 
  
    
      
        χ
        (
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi (s)}
   is the sum of the eigenvalues of 
  
    
      
        ρ
        (
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho (s)}
   with multiplicity. if the degree of the representation is n, then the sum is n long. if s has order m, these eigenvalues are all m-th roots of unity. this fact can be used to show that 
  
    
      
        χ
        (
        
          s
          
            −
            1
          
        
        )
        =
        
          
            
              χ
              (
              s
              )
            
            ¯
          
        
        ,
        
        
        
        ∀
        
        s
        ∈
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi (s^{-1})={\overline {\chi (s)}},\,\,\,\forall \,s\in g}
   and it also implies 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        χ
        (
        s
        )
        
          |
        
        ⩽
        n
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\chi (s)|\leqslant n.}
  
since the trace of the identity matrix is the number of rows, 
  
    
      
        χ
        (
        e
        )
        =
        n
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi (e)=n,}
   where 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is the neutral element of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   and n is the dimension of the representation. in general, 
  
    
      
        {
        s
        ∈
        g
        
          |
        
        χ
        (
        s
        )
        =
        n

=== inner product and characters ===

in order to show some particularly interesting results about characters, it is rewarding to consider a more general type of functions on groups:
definition (class functions). a function 
  
    
      
        φ
        :
        g
        →
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi :g\to \mathbb {c} }
    is called a class function if it is constant on conjugacy classes of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  , i.e. 

  
    
      
        ∀
        s
        ,
        t
        ∈
        g
        :
        
        φ
        
          (
          
            s
            t
            
              s
              
                −
                1
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        φ
        (
        t
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall s,t\in g:\quad \varphi \left(sts^{-1}\right)=\varphi (t).}
  note that every character is a class function, as the trace of a matrix is preserved under conjugation.
the set of all class functions is a 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} }
  –algebra and is denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
          
          
            class
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} _{\text{class}}(g)}
  . its dimension is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
  
proofs of the following results of this chapter may be found in [1], [2] and [3].
an inner product can be defined on the set of all class functions on a finite group:

  
    
      
        (
        f
        
          |

            g
          
        
        =

                |

every class function

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} _{\text{class}}(g)}
   by showing that there exists no nonzero class function which is orthogonal to all the irreducible characters. for 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   a representation and 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   a class function, denote

   then for

    {\displaystyle \rho _{f}={\frac {|g|}{n}}\langle f,\chi _{v}^{*}\rangle \in end(v)}
   from schur's lemma. suppose 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a class function which is orthogonal to all the characters. then by the above we have 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            f

   whenever 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is irreducible. but then it follows that 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            f

   for all 
  
    
      
        ρ

  , by decomposability. take 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   to be the regular representation. applying 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            f

   to some particular basis element 
  
    
      
        g

it follows from the orthonormal property that the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations of a group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of

  corollary. two representations with the same character are isomorphic. this means that every representation is determined by its character.with this we obtain a very useful result to analyse representations:
 irreducibility criterion. let 
  
    
      
        χ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi }
   be the character of the representation 
  
    
      
        v
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle v,}
   then we have 
  
    
      
        (
        χ
        
          |
        
        χ
        )
        ∈
        
          
            n
          
          
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\chi |\chi )\in \mathbb {n} _{0}.}
   the case 
  
    
      
        (
        χ
        
          |
        
        χ

        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\chi |\chi )=1}
   holds if and only if 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is irreducible.
therefore, using the first theorem, the characters of irreducible representations of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   form an orthonormal set on

        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} _{\text{class}}(g)}
   with respect to this inner product.

        e

   denotes the neutral element of the group.
this formula is a "necessary and sufficient" condition for the problem of classifying the irreducible representations of a group up to isomorphism. it provides us with the means to check whether we found all the isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of a group.
similarly, by using the character of the regular representation evaluated at 
  
    
      
        s
        ≠
        e
        ,

        0
        =
        
          χ
          
            r
          
        
        (
        s
        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            j
          
        
        dim
        ⁡
        (
        
          w
          
            j
          
        
        )

    {\displaystyle 0=\chi _{r}(s)=\sum _{j}\dim(w_{j})\cdot \chi _{w_{j}}(s).}
  using the description of representations via the convolution algebra we achieve an equivalent formulation of these equations:

                |
              
            
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            ρ
            
               irr. rep. of

        (

  in both formulas

lemma. let

   be a group. then the following is equivalent:

  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is abelian.
every function on 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is a class function.
all irreducible representations of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   have degree 
  
    
      
        1.

== the induced representation ==

as was shown in the section on properties of linear representations, we can - by restriction - obtain a representation of a subgroup starting from a representation of a group. naturally we are interested in the reverse process: is it possible to obtain the representation of a group starting from a representation of a subgroup? we will see that the induced representation defined below provides us with the necessary concept. admittedly, this construction is not inverse but rather adjoint to the restriction.

          res
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{res}}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          ind
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{ind}}}
   are adjoint to each other.
let 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}
   be an irreducible representation of 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   and let 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   be an irreducible representation of 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   then the frobenius reciprocity tells us that 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}
   is contained in 
  
    
      
        
          res
        
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{res}}(v)}
   as often as 
  
    
      
        
          ind
        
        (
        w
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{ind}}(w)}
   is contained in 
  
    
      
        v
        .

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \psi ,{\text{res}}(\varphi )\rangle _{h}=\langle {\text{ind}}(\psi ),\varphi \rangle _{g}.}
  this statement is also valid for the inner product.


=== mackey's irreducibility criterion ===
george mackey established a criterion to verify the irreducibility of induced representations. for this we will first need some definitions and some specifications with respect to the notation.
two representations 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            1

   and

   of a group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are called disjoint, if they have no irreducible component in common, i.e. if 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          v

        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle v_{1},v_{2}\rangle _{g}=0.}
  
let 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   be a group and let 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   be a subgroup. we define 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            s

        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{s}=shs^{-1}\cap h}
   for

        ∈
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\in g.}
   let 
  
    
      
        (
        ρ
        ,
        w
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\rho ,w)}
   be a representation of the subgroup 
  
    
      
        h
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h.}
   this defines by restriction a representation 
  
    
      
        
          
            res

                s
              
            
          
        
        (
        ρ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{res}}_{h_{s}}(\rho )}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            s
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{s}.}
   we write 
  
    
      
        
          
            res
          
          
            s
          
        
        (
        ρ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{res}}_{s}(\rho )}
   for 
  
    
      
        
          
            res

        (
        ρ
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{res}}_{h_{s}}(\rho ).}
   we also define another representation 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho ^{s}}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{s}}
   by 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            s
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        ρ
        (
        
          s
          
            −
            1
          
        
        t
        s
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho ^{s}(t)=\rho (s^{-1}ts).}
   these two representations are not to be confused.

   and

    {\displaystyle h_{s}}
   are disjoint.for the case of 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   normal, we have

            s

  .  thus we obtain the following:

=== applications to special groups ===
in this section we present some applications of the so far presented theory to normal subgroups and to a special group, the semidirect product of a subgroup with an abelian normal subgroup.

proposition. let 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   be a normal subgroup of the group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   and let 
  
    
      
        ρ
        :
        g
        →
        
          gl
        
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho :g\to {\text{gl}}(v)}
   be an irreducible representation of 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
   then one of the following statements has to be valid:
either there exists a proper subgroup 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   containing 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  , and an irreducible representation 
  
    
      
        η
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta }
   of 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   which induces 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
  ,
or 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is an isotypic 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} a}
  -module.
proof. consider 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   as an 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} a}
  -module, and decompose it into isotypes as 
  
    
      
        v
        =
        
          ⨁
          
            j
          
        
        
          
            v
            
              j
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v=\bigoplus _{j}{v_{j}}}
  .  if this decomposition is trivial, we are in the second case.  otherwise, the larger 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -action permutes these isotypic modules; because 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is irreducible as a 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} g}
  -module, the permutation action is transitive (in fact primitive).  fix any 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  ; the stabilizer in 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{j}}
   is elementarily seen to exhibit the claimed properties.     
  
    
      
        ◻
      
    
    {\displaystyle \box }
  note that if 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is abelian, then the isotypic modules of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   are irreducible, of degree one, and all homotheties.
we obtain also the following

corollary. let 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   be an abelian normal subgroup of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   and let 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   be any irreducible representation of 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
   we denote with 
  
    
      
        (
        g
        :
        a

==== classification of representations of a semidirect product ====
in the following, let 
  
    
      
        g
        =
        a
        ⋊
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle g=a\rtimes h}
   be a semidirect product such that the normal semidirect factor, 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  , is abelian.    the irreducible representations of such a group 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   can be classified by showing that all irreducible representations of 
  
    
      
        g

   can be constructed from certain subgroups of 
  
    
      
        h

since

   thus,

   moreover, since

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle t\in h_{j},}
   it can be shown that 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{j}}
   is a group homomorphism from

    {\displaystyle g_{j}}
   to 
  
    
      
        
          
            c

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} ^{\times }.}
   therefore, we have a representation of 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{j}}
   of degree one which is equal to its own character.
let now 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   be an irreducible representation of 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            j
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{j}.}
   then we obtain an irreducible representation 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              ρ

    {\displaystyle {\tilde {\rho }}}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            j
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{j},}
   by combining 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   with the canonical projection 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            j
          
        
        →
        
          h
          
            j
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{j}\to h_{j}.}
   finally, we construct the tensor product of 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{j}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              ρ
              ~
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tilde {\rho }}.}
   thus, we obtain an irreducible representation 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            j
          
        
        ⊗
        
          
            
              ρ
              ~
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{j}\otimes {\tilde {\rho }}}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            j
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{j}.}
  
to finally obtain the classification of the irreducible representations of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   we use the representation 
  
    
      
        
          θ
          
            j
            ,
            ρ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta _{j,\rho }}
   of 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   which is induced by the tensor product 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            j
          
        
        ⊗
        
          
            
              ρ
              ~
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{j}\otimes {\tilde {\rho }}.}
   thus, we achieve the following result:

    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is isomorphic to

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho '.}
  
every irreducible representation of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is isomorphic to one of the 
  
    
      
        
          θ
          
            j
            ,

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta _{j,\rho }.}
  amongst others, the criterion of mackey and a conclusion based on the frobenius reciprocity are needed for the proof of the proposition. further details may be found in [1].
in other words, we classified all irreducible representations of

because a representation is determined by its character,

   likewise, the induction on class functions defines a homomorphism of abelian groups 
  
    
      
        
          
            r

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {r}}(h)\to {\mathcal {r}}(g),}
   which will be written as 
  
    
      
        
          
            ind

    {\displaystyle {\text{ind}}_{h}^{g}}
   or in short 
  
    
      
        
          ind
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{ind}}.}
  
according to the frobenius reciprocity, these two homomorphisms are adjoint with respect to the bilinear forms 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅

    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle _{h}}
   and 
  
    
      
        ⟨

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle _{g}.}
   furthermore, the formula 
  
    
      
        
          ind
        
        (
        φ

        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{ind}}(\varphi \cdot {\text{res}}(\psi ))={\text{ind}}(\varphi )\cdot \psi }
   shows that the image of 
  
    
      
        
          ind
        
        :

        →
        
          
            r

        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{ind}}:{\mathcal {r}}(h)\to {\mathcal {r}}(g)}
   is an ideal of the ring 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
        
        (
        g
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {r}}(g).}
  
by the restriction of representations, the map 
  
    
      
        
          res
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{res}}}
   can be defined analogously for 
  
    
      
        r
        (
        g
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r(g),}
   and by the induction we obtain the map 
  
    
      
        
          ind
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{ind}}}
   for

        (
        g
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle r(g).}
   due to the frobenius reciprocity, we get the result that these maps are adjoint to each other and that the image 
  
    
      
        
          im

    {\displaystyle {\text{im}}({\text{ind}})={\text{ind}}(r(h))}
   is an ideal of the ring

== induction theorems ==
induction theorems relate the representation ring of a given finite group g to representation rings of a family x consisting of some subsets h of g. more precisely, for such a collection of subgroups, the induction functor yields a map 

  
    
      
        φ
        :
        
          ind
        
        :
        
          ⨁
          
            h
            ∈
            x
          
        
        
          
            r
          
        
        (
        h
        )
        →
        
          
            r
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi :{\text{ind}}:\bigoplus _{h\in x}{\mathcal {r}}(h)\to {\mathcal {r}}(g)}
  ; induction theorems give criteria for the surjectivity of this map or closely related ones.artin's induction theorem is the most elementary theorem in this group of results. it asserts that the following are equivalent:

the cokernel of 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   is finite.

  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is the union of the conjugates of the subgroups belonging to 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   i.e. 
  
    
      
        g
        =
        
          ⋃
          
            
              
                h

                x
              
              
                s
                ∈
                g

    {\displaystyle g=\bigcup _{h\in x \atop s\in g}shs^{-1}.}
  since 
  
    
      
        
          
            r

        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {r}}(g)}
   is finitely generated as a group, the first point can be rephrased as follows:

for each character 
  
    
      
        χ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi }
   of 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   there exist virtual characters 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            h
          
        
        ∈
        
          
            r
          
        
        (
        h
        )
        ,
        
        h
        ∈
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{h}\in {\mathcal {r}}(h),\,h\in x}
   and an integer 
  
    
      
        d
        ≥
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\geq 1,}
   such that 
  
    
      
        d
        ⋅
        χ
        =
        
          ∑
          
            h
            ∈
            x
          
        
        
          
            ind
          
          
            h
          
          
            g
          
        
        (
        
          χ
          
            h
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\cdot \chi =\sum _{h\in x}{\text{ind}}_{h}^{g}(\chi _{h}).}
  serre (1977) gives two proofs of this theorem. for example, since g is the union of its cyclic subgroups, every character of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is a linear combination with rational coefficients of characters induced by characters of cyclic subgroups of 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
   since the representations of cyclic groups are well-understood, in particular the irreducible representations are one-dimensional, this gives a certain control over representations of g.
under the above circumstances, it is not in general true that 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   is surjective. brauer's induction theorem asserts that 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   is surjective, provided that x is the family of all elementary subgroups.
here a group h is elementary if there is some prime p such that h is the direct product of a cyclic group of order prime to 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   and a 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  –group.
in other words, every character of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is a linear combination with integer coefficients of characters induced by characters of elementary subgroups.
the elementary subgroups h arising in brauer's theorem have a richer representation theory than cyclic groups, they at least have the property that any irreducible representation for such h is induced by a one-dimensional representation of a (necessarily also elementary) subgroup 
  
    
      
        k
        ⊂
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\subset h}
  . (this latter property can be shown to hold for any supersolvable group, which includes nilpotent groups and, in particular, elementary groups.) this ability to induce representations from degree 1 representations has some further consequences in the representation theory of finite groups.

   to find such a group, observe that

  inherits from these constructions the structure of a hopf algebra which, it turns out, is closely related to symmetric functions.

== outlook—representations of compact groups ==
the theory of representations of compact groups may be, to some degree, extended to locally compact groups. the representation theory unfolds in this context great importance for harmonic analysis and the study of automorphic forms. for proofs, further information and for a more detailed insight which is beyond the scope of this chapter please consult  [4] and  [5].

   we can do without the last requirement. in the following, we will consider in particular representations of compact groups in hilbert spaces.
just as with finite groups, we can define the group algebra and the convolution algebra. however, the group algebra provides no helpful information in the case of infinite groups, because the continuity condition gets lost during the construction. instead the convolution algebra 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            1
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{1}(g)}
   takes its place.
most properties of representations of finite groups can be transferred with appropriate changes to compact groups. for this we need a counterpart to the summation over a finite group:


=== existence and uniqueness of the haar measure ===
on a compact group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   there exists exactly one measure 
  
    
      
        d
        t
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle dt,}
   such that:

it is a left-translation-invariant measure
  
    
      
        ∀
        s
        ∈
        g
        :
        
        
          ∫
          
            g
          
        
        f
        (
        t
        )
        d
        t
        =
        
          ∫
          
            g
          
        
        f
        (
        s
        t
        )
        d
        t
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall s\in g:\quad \int _{g}f(t)dt=\int _{g}f(st)dt.}
  the whole group has unit measure:
  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            g
          
        
        d
        t
        =
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{g}dt=1,}
  such a left-translation-invariant, normed measure is called haar measure of the group 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
  
since 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is compact, it is possible to show that this measure is also right-translation-invariant, i.e. it also applies

  
    
      
        ∀
        s
        ∈
        g
        :
        
        
          ∫
          
            g
          
        
        f
        (
        t
        )
        d
        t
        =
        
          ∫

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall s\in g:\quad \int _{g}f(t)dt=\int _{g}f(ts)dt.}
  by the scaling above the haar measure on a finite group is given by 
  
    
      
        d
        t
        (
        s
        )
        =
        
          
            
              1
              
                
                  |
                
                g

    {\displaystyle dt(s)={\tfrac {1}{|g|}}}
   for all 
  
    
      
        s
        ∈
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\in g.}
  
all the definitions to representations of finite groups that are mentioned in the section ”properties”, also apply to representations of compact groups. but there are some modifications needed:
to define a subrepresentation we now need a closed subspace. this was not necessary for finite-dimensional representation spaces, because in this case every subspace is already closed. furthermore, two representations 
  
    
      
        ρ
        ,
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho ,\pi }
   of a compact group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are called equivalent, if there exists a bijective, continuous, linear operator 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   between the representation spaces whose inverse is also continuous and which satisfies 
  
    
      
        t
        ∘
        ρ
        (
        s
        )
        =
        π
        (
        s
        )
        ∘
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t\circ \rho (s)=\pi (s)\circ t}
   for all 
  
    
      
        s
        ∈
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\in g.}
  
if 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is unitary, the two representations are called unitary equivalent.
to obtain a 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  –invariant inner product from a not 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  –invariant, we now have to use the integral over 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   instead of the sum. if 
  
    
      
        (
        ⋅
        
          |
        
        ⋅
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\cdot |\cdot )}
   is an inner product on a hilbert space 
  
    
      
        v
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle v,}
   which is not invariant with respect to the representation 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   of 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   then

  
    
      
        (
        v
        
          |
        
        u
        
          )
          
            ρ
          
        
        =
        
          ∫
          
            g
          
        
        (
        ρ
        (
        t
        )
        v
        
          |
        
        ρ
        (
        t
        )
        u
        )
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle (v|u)_{\rho }=\int _{g}(\rho (t)v|\rho (t)u)dt}
  is a 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  –invariant inner product on 
  
    
      
        v

        d

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle dt.}
   thus, we can assume every representation on a hilbert space to be unitary.
let 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   be a compact group and let

   we define the operator

   on this space by

    {\displaystyle l_{s}\phi (t)=\phi (s^{-1}t),}
   where 
  
    
      
        φ
        ∈
        
          l

            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\mapsto l_{s}}
   is a unitary representation of 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
   it is called left-regular representation. the right-regular representation is defined similarly. as the haar measure of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is also right-translation-invariant, the operator 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{s}}
   on 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}(g)}
   is given by 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            s

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{s}\phi (t)=\phi (ts).}
   the right-regular representation is then the unitary representation given by  
  
    
      
        s
        ↦
        
          r
          
            s
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\mapsto r_{s}.}
   the two representations 
  
    
      
        s
        ↦
        
          l
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\mapsto l_{s}}
   and 
  
    
      
        s
        ↦
        
          r
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\mapsto r_{s}}
   are dual to each other.
if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is infinite, these representations have no finite degree. the left- and right-regular representation as defined at the beginning are isomorphic to the left- and right-regular representation as defined above, if the group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is finite. this is due to the fact that in this case 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2

          c
        
        [
        g
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}(g)\cong l^{1}(g)\cong \mathbb {c} [g].}
  


=== constructions and decompositions ===
the different ways of constructing new representations from given ones can be used for compact groups as well, except for the dual representation with which we will deal later. the direct sum and the tensor product with a finite number of summands/factors are defined in exactly the same way as for finite groups. this is also the case for the symmetric and alternating square. however, we need a haar measure on the direct product of compact groups in order to extend the theorem saying that the irreducible representations of the product of two groups are (up to isomorphism) exactly the tensor product of the irreducible representations of the factor groups. first, we note that the direct product  
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ×
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{1}\times g_{2}}
   of two compact groups is again a compact group when provided with the product topology. the haar measure on the direct product is then given by the product of the haar measures on the factor groups.
for the dual representation on compact groups we require the topological dual 
  
    
      
        
          v
          ′

=== characters, schur's lemma and the inner product ===
generally, representations of compact groups are investigated on hilbert- and banach spaces. in most cases they are not finite-dimensional. therefore, it is not useful to refer to characters when speaking about representations of compact groups. nevertheless, in most cases it is possible to restrict the study to the case of finite dimensions:
since irreducible representations of compact groups are finite-dimensional and unitary (see results from the first subsection), we can define irreducible characters in the same way as it was done for finite groups.
as long as the constructed representations stay finite-dimensional, the characters of the newly constructed representations may be obtained in the same way as for finite groups.
schur's lemma is also valid for compact groups:
let 
  
    
      
        (
        π
        ,
        v

   be an irreducible unitary representation of a compact group

            2
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}(g)}
   with respect to this inner product.as we already know that the non-isomorphic irreducible representations are orthonormal, we only need to verify that they generate 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
        (
        g
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}(g).}
   this may be done, by proving that there exists no non-zero square integrable function on 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   orthogonal to all the irreducible characters.
just as in the case of finite groups, the number of the irreducible representations up to isomorphism of a group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   equals the number of conjugacy classes of 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
   however, because a compact group has in general infinitely many conjugacy classes, this does not provide any useful information.


=== the induced representation ===
if 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is a closed subgroup of finite index in a compact group 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   the definition of the induced representation for finite groups may be adopted.
however, the induced representation can be defined more generally, so that the definition is valid independent of the index of the subgroup 
  
    
      
        h
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h.}
  
for this purpose let 
  
    
      
        (
        η
        ,
        
          v
          
            η
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\eta ,v_{\eta })}
   be a unitary representation of the closed subgroup 
  
    
      
        h
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h.}
   the continuous induced representation 
  
    
      
        
          
            ind
          
          
            h
          
          
            g
          
        
        (
        η
        )
        =
        (
        i
        ,
        
          v
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{ind}}_{h}^{g}(\eta )=(i,v_{i})}
   is defined as follows:
let 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{i}}
   denote the hilbert space of all measurable, square integrable functions 
  
    
      
        φ
        :
        g
        →
        
          v
          
            η
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :g\to v_{\eta }}
   with the property 
  
    
      
        φ
        (
        l
        s
        )
        =
        η
        (
        l
        )
        φ
        (
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi (ls)=\eta (l)\phi (s)}
   for all 
  
    
      
        l
        ∈
        h
        ,
        s
        ∈
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle l\in h,s\in g.}
   the norm is given by

  
    
      
        ‖
        φ
        
          ‖
          
            g
          
        
        =
        
          
            sup
          
          
            s
            ∈
            g
          
        
        ‖
        φ
        (
        s
        )
        ‖
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|\phi \|_{g}={\text{sup}}_{s\in g}\|\phi (s)\|}
  and the representation 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   is given as the right-translation: 
  
    
      
        i
        (
        s
        )
        φ
        (
        k
        )
        =
        φ
        (
        k
        s
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle i(s)\phi (k)=\phi (ks).}
  
the induced representation is then again a unitary representation.
since 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is compact, the induced representation can be decomposed into the direct sum of irreducible representations of 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
   note that all irreducible representations belonging to the same isotype appear with a multiplicity equal to 
  
    
      
        dim
        ⁡
        (

        ,
        
          v
          
            i
          
        
        )
        )
        =
        ⟨

        ,

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \dim({\text{hom}}_{g}(v_{\eta },v_{i}))=\langle v_{\eta },v_{i}\rangle _{g}.}
  
let 
  
    
      
        (
        ρ
        ,
        
          v

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\rho ,v_{\rho })}
   be a representation of 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   then there exists a canonical isomorphism

  
    
      
        t
        :
        
          
            hom

        )
        )
        →

    {\displaystyle t:{\text{hom}}_{g}(v_{\rho },i_{h}^{g}(\eta ))\to {\text{hom}}_{h}(v_{\rho }|_{h},v_{\eta }).}
  the frobenius reciprocity transfers, together with the modified definitions of the inner product and of the bilinear form, to compact groups. the theorem now holds for square integrable functions on 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   instead of class functions, but the subgroup 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   must be closed.


=== the peter-weyl theorem ===

another important result in the representation theory of compact groups is the peter-weyl theorem. it is usually presented and proven in harmonic analysis, as it represents one of its central and fundamental statements.

the peter-weyl theorem. let 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   be a compact group. for every irreducible representation 
  
    
      
        (

        ,

   let

    {\displaystyle \{e_{1},\ldots ,e_{\dim(\tau )}\}}
   be an orthonormal basis of

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{\tau }.}
   we define the matrix coefficients 
  
    
      
        
          τ
          
            k

            l
          
        
        (

        =

            k
          
        
        ,
        
          e

    {\displaystyle \tau _{k,l}(s)=\langle \tau (s)e_{k},e_{l}\rangle }
   for 
  
    
      
        k
        ,
        l
        ∈
        {
        1
        ,
        …
        ,
        dim
        ⁡
        (

        ,

        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle k,l\in \{1,\ldots ,\dim(\tau )\},s\in g.}
   then we have the following orthonormal basis of 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2

    {\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {\dim(\tau )}}\tau _{k,l}\right)_{k,l}}
  we can reformulate this theorem to obtain a generalization of the fourier series for functions on compact groups:

== history ==
the general features of the representation theory of a finite group g, over the complex numbers, were discovered by ferdinand georg frobenius in the years before 1900. later the modular representation theory of richard brauer was developed.
