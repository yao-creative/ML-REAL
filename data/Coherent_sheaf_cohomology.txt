in mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, coherent sheaf cohomology is a technique for producing functions with specified properties. many geometric questions can be formulated as questions about the existence of sections of line bundles or of more general coherent sheaves; such sections can be viewed as generalized functions. cohomology provides computable tools for producing sections, or explaining why they do not exist. it also provides invariants to distinguish one algebraic variety from another.
much of algebraic geometry and complex analytic geometry is formulated in terms of coherent sheaves and their cohomology.


== coherent sheaves ==

coherent sheaves can be seen as a generalization of vector bundles. there is a notion of a coherent analytic sheaf on a complex analytic space, and an analogous notion of a coherent algebraic sheaf on a scheme. in both cases, the given space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   comes with a sheaf of rings 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
  , the sheaf of holomorphic functions or regular functions, and coherent sheaves are defined as a full subcategory of the category of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
  -modules (that is, sheaves of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
  -modules).
vector bundles such as the tangent bundle play a fundamental role in geometry. more generally, for a closed subvariety 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   with inclusion 
  
    
      
        i
        :
        y
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle i:y\to x}
  , a vector bundle 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   on 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   determines a coherent sheaf on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , the direct image sheaf 
  
    
      
        
          i
          
            ∗
          
        
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle i_{*}e}
  , which is zero outside 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
  . in this way, many questions about subvarieties of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   can be expressed in terms of coherent sheaves on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .
unlike vector bundles, coherent sheaves (in the analytic or algebraic case) form an abelian category, and so they are closed under operations such as taking kernels, images, and cokernels. on a scheme, the quasi-coherent sheaves are a generalization of coherent sheaves, including the locally free sheaves of infinite rank.

== vanishing theorems in the affine case ==
complex analysis was revolutionized by cartan's theorems a and b in 1953. these results say that if

  .) these results generalize a large body of older work about the construction of complex analytic functions with given singularities or other properties.
in 1955, serre introduced coherent sheaves into algebraic geometry (at first over an algebraically closed field, but that restriction was removed by grothendieck). the analogs of cartan's theorems hold in great generality: if 
  
    
      
        
          
            f

   is a quasi-coherent sheaf on an affine scheme 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , then 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   is spanned by its global sections, and 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            i
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        
          
            f
          
        
        )
        =

        i

        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle i>0}

    {\displaystyle x}

the finite-dimensionality of cohomology also holds in the analogous situation of coherent analytic sheaves on any compact complex space, by a very different argument. cartan and serre proved finite-dimensionality in this analytic situation using a theorem of schwartz on compact operators in fréchet spaces. relative versions of this result for a proper morphism were proved by grothendieck (for locally noetherian schemes) and by grauert (for complex analytic spaces). namely, for a proper morphism

== gaga theorems ==

gaga theorems relate algebraic varieties over the complex numbers to the corresponding analytic spaces. for a scheme x of finite type over c, there is a functor from coherent algebraic sheaves on x to coherent analytic sheaves on the associated analytic space xan. the key gaga theorem (by grothendieck, generalizing serre's theorem on the projective case) is that if x is proper over c, then this functor is an equivalence of categories. moreover, for every coherent algebraic sheaf e on a proper scheme x over c, the natural map

  
    
      
        
          h

    {\displaystyle h^{i}(x,e)\to h^{i}(x^{\text{an}},e^{\text{an}})}
  of (finite-dimensional) complex vector spaces is an isomorphism for all i. (the first group here is defined using the zariski topology, and the second using the classical (euclidean) topology.) for example, the equivalence between algebraic and analytic coherent sheaves on projective space implies chow's theorem that every closed analytic subspace of cpn is algebraic.

== hodge theory ==

the hodge theorem relates coherent sheaf cohomology to singular cohomology (or de rham cohomology). namely, if

    {\displaystyle x}
   is a smooth complex projective variety, then there is a canonical direct-sum decomposition of complex vector spaces:

            a

    {\displaystyle h^{a}(x,\mathbf {c} )\cong \bigoplus _{b=0}^{a}h^{a-b}(x,\omega ^{b}),}
  for every 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}

    {\displaystyle x(\mathbf {c} )}
   in its classical (euclidean) topology, whereas the groups on the right are cohomology groups of coherent sheaves, which (by gaga) can be taken either in the zariski or in the classical topology. the same conclusion holds for any smooth proper scheme 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   over 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} }
  , or for any compact kähler manifold.
for example, the hodge theorem implies that the definition of the genus of a smooth projective curve

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{1}(x,{\mathcal {o}})}
  , which makes sense over any field 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  , agrees with the topological definition (as half the first betti number) when 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is the complex numbers. hodge theory has inspired a large body of work on the topological properties of complex algebraic varieties.

  the euler characteristic of a coherent sheaf e can be computed from the chern classes of e, according to the riemann–roch theorem and its generalizations, the hirzebruch–riemann–roch theorem and the grothendieck–riemann–roch theorem. for example, if l is a line bundle on a smooth proper geometrically connected curve x over a field k, then

  
    
      
        χ
        (
        x
        ,
        l
        )
        =
        
          deg
        
        (
        l
        )
        −
        
          genus
        
        (
        x
        )

        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi (x,l)={\text{deg}}(l)-{\text{genus}}(x)+1,}
  where deg(l) denotes the degree of l.
when combined with a vanishing theorem, the riemann–roch theorem can often be used to determine the dimension of the vector space of sections of a line bundle. knowing that a line bundle on x has enough sections, in turn, can be used to define a map from x to projective space, perhaps a closed immersion. this approach is essential for classifying algebraic varieties.
the riemann–roch theorem also holds for holomorphic vector bundles on a compact complex manifold, by the atiyah–singer index theorem.
