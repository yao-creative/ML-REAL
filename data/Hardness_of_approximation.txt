in computer science, hardness of approximation is a field  that studies the algorithmic complexity of finding near-optimal solutions to optimization problems.


== scope ==
hardness of approximation complements the study of approximation algorithms by proving, for certain problems, a limit on the factors with which their solution can be efficiently approximated. typically such limits show a factor of approximation beyond which a problem becomes np-hard, implying that finding a polynomial time approximation for the problem is impossible unless np=p. some hardness of approximation results, however, are based on other hypotheses, a notable one among which is the unique games conjecture.


== history ==
since the early 1970s it was known that many optimization problems could not be solved in polynomial time unless p = np, but in many of these problems the optimal solution could be efficiently approximated to a certain degree. in the 1970s, teofilo f. gonzalez and sartaj sahni began the study of hardness of approximation, by showing that certain optimization problems were np-hard even to approximate to within a given approximation ratio. that is, for these problems, there is a threshold such that any polynomial-time approximation with approximation ratio beyond this threshold could be used to solve np-complete problems in polynomial time.  in the early 1990s, with the development of pcp theory, it became clear that many more approximation problems were hard to approximate, and that (unless p = np) many known approximation algorithms achieved the best possible approximation ratio.
hardness of approximation theory deals with studying the approximation threshold of such problems.
