in mathematics, a vector bundle is said to be flat if it is endowed with a linear connection with vanishing curvature, i.e. a flat connection.

let 
  
    
      
        π
        :
        e
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi :e\to x}
   denote a flat vector bundle, and 
  
    
      
        ∇
        :
        γ
        (
        x
        ,
        e
        )
        →
        γ
        
          (
          
            x
            ,
            
              ω
              
                x
              
              
                1
              
            
            ⊗
            e
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nabla :\gamma (x,e)\to \gamma \left(x,\omega _{x}^{1}\otimes e\right)}
   be the covariant derivative associated to the flat connection on e.
let 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            x
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        e
        )
        =
        
          ω
          
            x
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        ⊗
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{x}^{*}(e)=\omega _{x}^{*}\otimes e}
   denote the vector space (in fact a sheaf of modules over 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
  ) of differential forms on x with values in e. the covariant derivative defines a degree-1 endomorphism d, the differential of 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            x
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{x}^{*}(e)}
  , and the flatness condition is equivalent to the property 
  
    
      
        
          d
          
            2
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle d^{2}=0}
  .
in other words, the graded vector space 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            x
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{x}^{*}(e)}
   is a cochain complex. its cohomology is called the de rham cohomology of e, or de rham cohomology with coefficients twisted by the local coefficient system e.


== flat trivializations ==
a trivialization of a flat vector bundle is said to be flat if the connection form vanishes in this trivialization. an equivalent definition of a flat bundle is the choice of a trivializing atlas with locally constant transition maps.


== examples ==
trivial line bundles can have several flat bundle structures. an example is the trivial bundle over 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        ∖
        {
        0
        }
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} \backslash \{0\},}
   with the connection forms 0 and 
  
    
      
        −
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        
          
            
              d
              z
            
            z
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {dz}{z}}}
  . the parallel vector fields are constant in the first case, and proportional to local determinations of the square root in the second.
the real canonical line bundle 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            
              t
              o
              p
            
          
        
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda ^{\mathrm {top} }m}
   of a differential manifold m is a flat line bundle, called the orientation bundle. its sections are volume forms.
a riemannian manifold is flat if and only if its levi-civita connection gives its tangent vector bundle a flat structure.
