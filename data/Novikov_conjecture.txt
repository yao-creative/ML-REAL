this page concerns mathematician sergei novikov's topology conjecture. for astrophysicist igor novikov's conjecture regarding time travel, see novikov self-consistency principle.the novikov conjecture is one of the most important unsolved problems in topology.  it is named for sergei novikov who originally posed the conjecture in 1965.
the novikov conjecture concerns the homotopy invariance of certain polynomials in the pontryagin classes of a manifold, arising from the fundamental group. according to the novikov conjecture, the higher signatures, which are certain numerical invariants of smooth manifolds, are homotopy invariants.
the conjecture has been proved for finitely generated abelian groups. it is not yet known whether the novikov conjecture holds true for all groups.  there are no known counterexamples to the conjecture.

        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle h\colon m'\rightarrow m}
   is an orientation preserving homotopy equivalence, the higher signature associated to 
  
    
      
        f
        ∘
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\circ h}
   is equal to that associated to 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  .


== connection with the borel conjecture ==
the novikov conjecture is equivalent to the rational injectivity of the assembly map in l-theory. the 
borel conjecture on the rigidity of aspherical manifolds is equivalent to the assembly map being an isomorphism.
