in algebra, the real radical of an ideal i in a polynomial ring with real coefficients is the largest ideal containing i with the same vanishing locus.
it plays a similar role in real algebraic geometry that the radical of an ideal plays in algebraic geometry over an algebraically closed field.
more specifically, the nullstellensatz says that when i is an ideal in a polynomial ring with coefficients coming from an algebraically closed field, the radical of i is the set of polynomials vanishing on the vanishing locus of i. in real algebraic geometry, the nullstellensatz fails as the real numbers are not algebraically closed. however, one can recover a similar theorem, the real nullstellensatz, by using the real radical in place of the (ordinary) radical.

  the positivstellensatz then implies that

    {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{\mathbb {r} }]{i}}}
   is the set of all polynomials that vanish on the real variety defined by the vanishing of 
  
    
      
        i
