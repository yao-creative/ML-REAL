in mathematics and theoretical physics, an invariant differential operator is a kind of mathematical map from some objects to an object of similar type. these objects are typically functions on 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
  , functions on a manifold, vector valued functions, vector fields, or, more generally, sections of a vector bundle.
in an invariant differential operator 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  , the term differential operator indicates that the value 
  
    
      
        d
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle df}
   of the map depends only on 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)}
   and the derivatives of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . the word invariant indicates that the operator contains some symmetry. this means that there is a group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   with a group action on the functions (or other objects in question) and this action is preserved by the operator:

  
    
      
        d
        (
        g
        ⋅
        f
        )
        =
        g
        ⋅
        (
        d
        f
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(g\cdot f)=g\cdot (df).}
  usually, the action of the group has the meaning of a change of coordinates (change of observer) and the invariance means that the operator has the same expression in all admissible coordinates.

equivalence classes of connections arise naturally in differential geometry, for example:

in conformal geometry an equivalence class of connections is given by the levi civita connections of all metrics in the conformal class;
in projective geometry an equivalence class of connection is given by all connections that have the same geodesics;
in cr geometry an equivalence class of connections is given by the tanaka-webster connections for each choice of pseudohermitian structure

  , we can write the sphere 
  
    
      
        
          s

   as the space of generators of the nil cone

    {\displaystyle g=so_{0}(n+1,1)}
   and p the stabilizer of a point in
