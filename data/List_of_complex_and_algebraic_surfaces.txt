== families of surfaces with members in multiple classes ==
surfaces that are also shimura varieties:
hilbert modular surfaces
humbert surfaces
picard modular surfaces
shioda modular surfaces
elliptic surfaces, surfaces with an elliptic fibration; quasielliptic surfaces constitute a modification this idea that occurs in finite characteristic
