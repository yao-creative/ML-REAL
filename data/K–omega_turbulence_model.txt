in computational fluid dynamics, the k–omega (k–ω) turbulence model is a common two-equation turbulence model, that is used as an approximation for the reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations (rans equations). the model attempts to predict turbulence by two partial differential equations for two variables, k and ω, with the first variable being the turbulence kinetic energy (k) while the second (ω) is the specific rate of dissipation (of the turbulence kinetic energy k into internal thermal energy).

the eddy viscosity νt, as needed in the rans equations, is given by: νt = k/ω, while the evolution of k and ω is modelled as:
