the lenstra elliptic-curve factorization or the elliptic-curve factorization method (ecm) is a fast, sub-exponential running time, algorithm for integer factorization, which employs elliptic curves.  for general-purpose factoring, ecm is the third-fastest known factoring method.  the second-fastest is the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve, and the fastest is the general number field sieve. the lenstra elliptic-curve factorization is named after hendrik lenstra.
practically speaking, ecm is considered a special-purpose factoring algorithm, as it is most suitable for finding small factors. currently, it is still the best algorithm for divisors not exceeding 50 to 60 digits, as its running time is dominated by the size of the smallest factor p rather than by the size of the number n to be factored. frequently, ecm is used to remove small factors from a very large integer with many factors; if the remaining integer is still composite, then it has only large factors and is factored using general-purpose techniques. the largest factor found using ecm so far has 83 decimal digits and was discovered on 7 september 2013 by r. propper. increasing the number of curves tested improves the chances of finding a factor, but they are not linear with the increase in the number of digits.

  , with equation of the form

one can define addition of two points on the curve, to define a group. the addition laws are given in the article on elliptic curves.

if we finish all the calculations above without encountering non-invertible elements (

== why does the algorithm work? ==
if p and q are two prime divisors of n, then y2 = x3 + ax + b (mod n) implies the same equation also modulo p and modulo q. these two smaller elliptic curves with the 
  
    
      
        ⊞
      
    
    {\displaystyle \boxplus }
  -addition are now genuine groups. if these groups have np and nq elements, respectively, then for any point p on the original curve, by lagrange's theorem, k > 0 is minimal such that 
  
    
      
        k
        p
        =
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle kp=\infty }
   on the curve modulo p implies that k divides np; moreover, 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            p
          
        
        p
        =
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{p}p=\infty }
  . the analogous statement holds for the curve modulo q. when the elliptic curve is chosen randomly, then np and nq are random numbers close to p + 1 and q + 1, respectively (see below). hence it is unlikely that most of the prime factors of np and nq are the same, and it is quite likely that while computing ep, we will encounter some kp that is ∞ modulo p but not modulo q, or vice versa. when this is the case, kp does not exist on the original curve, and in the computations we found some v with either gcd(v,p) = p or gcd(v, q) = q, but not both. that is, gcd(v, n) gave a non-trivial factor of n.
ecm is at its core an improvement of the older p − 1 algorithm. the p − 1 algorithm finds prime factors p such that p − 1 is b-powersmooth for small values of b. for any e, a multiple of p − 1, and any a relatively prime to p, by fermat's little theorem we have ae ≡ 1 (mod p). then gcd(ae − 1, n) is likely to produce a factor of n. however, the algorithm fails when p - 1 has large prime factors, as is the case for numbers containing strong primes, for example.
ecm gets around this obstacle by considering the group of a random elliptic curve over the finite field zp, rather than considering the multiplicative group of zp which always has order p − 1.
the order of the group of an elliptic curve over zp varies (quite randomly) between p + 1 − 2√p and p + 1 + 2√p by hasse's theorem, and is likely to be smooth for some elliptic curves.  although there is no proof that a smooth group order will be found in the hasse-interval, by using heuristic probabilistic methods, the canfield–erdős–pomerance theorem with suitably optimized parameter choices, and the l-notation, we can expect to try l[√2/2, √2] curves before getting a smooth group order. this heuristic estimate is very reliable in practice.


== an example ==
the following example is from trappe & washington (2006), with some details added.
we want to factor n = 455839. let's choose the elliptic curve y2 = x3 + 5x – 5, with the point p = (1, 1) on it, and let's try to compute (10!)p.
the slope of the tangent line at some point a=(x, y) is s = (3x2 + 5)/(2y) (mod n). using s we can compute 2a. if the value of s is of the form a/b where b > 1 and gcd(a,b) = 1, we have to find the modular inverse of b. if it does not exist, gcd(n,b) is a non-trivial factor of n.
first we compute 2p. we have s(p) = s(1,1) = 4, so the coordinates of 2p = (x′, y′) are x′ = s2 – 2x = 14 and y′ = s(x – x′) – y = 4(1 – 14) – 1 = –53, all numbers understood (mod n). just to check that this 2p is indeed on the curve: (–53)2 = 2809 = 143 + 5·14 – 5.
then we compute 3(2p). we have s(2p) = s(14,-53) = –593/106 (mod n). using the euclidean algorithm: 455839 = 4300·106 + 39, then 106 = 2·39 + 28, then 39 = 28 + 11, then 28 = 2·11 + 6, then 11 = 6 + 5, then 6 = 5 + 1. hence gcd(455839, 106) = 1, and working backwards (a version of the extended euclidean algorithm): 1 = 6 – 5 = 2·6 – 11 = 2·28 – 5·11 = 7·28 – 5·39 = 7·106 – 19·39 = 81707·106 – 19·455839. hence 106−1 = 81707 (mod 455839), and –593/106 = –133317 (mod 455839). given this s, we can compute the coordinates of 2(2p), just as we did above: 4p = (259851, 116255). just to check that this is indeed a point on the curve: y2 = 54514 = x3 + 5x – 5 (mod 455839). after this, we can compute 
  
    
      
        3
        (
        2
        p
        )
        =
        4
        p
        ⊞
        2
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle 3(2p)=4p\boxplus 2p}
  .
we can similarly compute 4!p, and so on, but 8!p requires inverting 599 (mod 455839). the euclidean algorithm gives that 455839 is divisible by 599, and we have found a factorization 455839 = 599·761.
the reason that this worked is that the curve (mod 599) has 640 = 27·5 points, while (mod 761) it has 777 = 3·7·37 points. moreover, 640 and 777 are the smallest positive integers k such that kp = ∞ on the curve (mod 599) and (mod 761), respectively. since 8! is a multiple of 640 but not a multiple of 777, we have 8!p = ∞ on the curve (mod 599), but not on the curve (mod 761), hence the repeated addition broke down here, yielding the factorization.

in the algorithm, only the group structure of an elliptic curve over the field ℝ is used. since we do not necessarily need the field ℝ, a finite field will also provide a group structure on an elliptic curve. however, considering the same curve and operation over

the use of edwards curves needs fewer modular multiplications and less time than the use of montgomery curves or weierstrass curves (other used methods). using edwards curves you can also find more primes.

   an edwards curve is a twisted edwards curve in which 
  
    
      
        a
        =

there are five known ways to build a set of points on an edwards curve: the set of affine points, the set of projective points, the set of inverted points, the set of extended points and the set of completed points.
the set of affine points is given by:

  
    
      
        {

    {\displaystyle \{(x,y)\in \mathbb {a} ^{2}:ax^{2}+y^{2}=1+dx^{2}y^{2}\}}
  .the addition law is given by

    {\displaystyle (e,f),(g,h)\mapsto \left({\frac {eh+fg}{1+degfh}},{\frac {fh-aeg}{1-degfh}}\right).}
  the point (0,1) is its neutral element and the inverse of 
  
    
      
        (
        e
        ,
        f

        f
        )

the other representations are defined similar to how the projective weierstrass curve follows from the affine.
any elliptic curve in edwards form has a point of order 4. so the torsion group of an edwards curve over

== gmp-ecm and eecm-mpfq ==
the use of twisted edwards elliptic curves, as well as other techniques were used by bernstein et al to provide an optimized implementation of ecm. its only drawback is that it works on smaller composite numbers than the more general purpose implementation, gmp-ecm of zimmerman.


== hyperelliptic-curve method (hecm) ==
there are recent developments in using hyperelliptic curves to factor integers. cosset shows in his article (of 2010) that one can build a hyperelliptic curve with genus two (so a curve 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            2
          
        
        =
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle y^{2}=f(x)}
   with f of degree 5), which gives the same result as using two "normal" elliptic curves at the same time. by making use of the kummer surface, calculation is more efficient. the disadvantages of the hyperelliptic curve (versus an elliptic curve) are compensated by this alternative way of calculating. therefore, cosset roughly claims that using hyperelliptic curves for factorization is no worse than using elliptic curves.


== quantum version (geecm) ==
bernstein, heninger, lou, & valenta suggest geecm, a quantum version of ecm with edwards curves. it uses grover's algorithm to roughly double the length of the primes found compared to standard eecm, assuming a quantum computer with sufficiently many qubits and of comparable speed to the classical computer running eecm.
