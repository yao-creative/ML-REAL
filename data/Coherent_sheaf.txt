in mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds, coherent sheaves are a class of sheaves closely linked to the geometric properties of the underlying space. the definition of coherent sheaves is made with reference to a sheaf of rings that codifies this geometric information.
coherent sheaves can be seen as a generalization of vector bundles. unlike vector bundles, they form an abelian category, and so they are closed under operations such as taking kernels, images, and cokernels. the  quasi-coherent sheaves are a generalization of coherent sheaves and include the locally free sheaves of infinite rank.
coherent sheaf cohomology is a powerful technique, in particular for studying the sections of a given coherent sheaf.

here are several further characterizations of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme.


== properties ==
on an arbitrary ringed space quasi-coherent sheaves do not necessarily form an abelian category. on the other hand, the quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form an abelian category, and they are extremely useful in that context.on any ringed space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , the coherent sheaves form an abelian category, a full subcategory of the category of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
  -modules. (analogously, the category of coherent modules over any ring 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is a full abelian subcategory of the category of all 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  -modules.) so the kernel, image, and cokernel of any map of coherent sheaves are coherent. the direct sum of two coherent sheaves is coherent; more generally, an

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
  -module that is an extension of two coherent sheaves is coherent.a submodule of a coherent sheaf is coherent if it is of finite type. a coherent sheaf is always an

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a coherent sheaf of rings. the main part of the proof is the case 
  
    
      
        x

    {\displaystyle x=\mathbf {c} ^{n}}
  . likewise, on a locally noetherian scheme 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , the structure sheaf

        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
  .the direct image of a coherent sheaf is often not coherent. for example, for a field 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  , let 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   be the affine line over 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  , and consider the morphism 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        spec
        ⁡
        (
        k
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:x\to \operatorname {spec} (k)}
  ; then the direct image 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            ∗
          
        
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{*}{\mathcal {o}}_{x}}

        spec
        ⁡

        k
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {spec} (k)}
   associated to the polynomial ring 
  
    
      
        k
        [
        x
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle k[x]}
  , which is not coherent because 
  
    
      
        k
        [
        x
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle k[x]}
   has infinite dimension as a 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -vector space. on the other hand, the direct image of a coherent sheaf under a proper morphism is coherent, by results of grauert and grothendieck.


== local behavior of coherent sheaves ==
an important feature of coherent sheaves 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   is that the properties of 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   at a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   control the behavior of 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   in a neighborhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , more than would be true for an arbitrary sheaf. for example, nakayama's lemma says (in geometric language) that if 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   is a coherent sheaf on a scheme 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , then the fiber 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              f

                  o

        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}_{x}\otimes _{{\mathcal {o}}_{x,x}}k(x)}
   of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   at a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (a vector space over the residue field 
  
    
      
        k
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k(x)}
  ) is zero if and only if the sheaf 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   is zero on some open neighborhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . a related fact is that the dimension of the fibers of a coherent sheaf is upper-semicontinuous. thus a coherent sheaf has constant rank on an open set, while the rank can jump up on a lower-dimensional closed subset.
in the same spirit: a coherent sheaf 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   on a scheme 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a vector bundle if and only if its stalk 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              f
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}_{x}}
   is a free module over the local ring 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
            ,
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x,x}}
   for every point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .on a general scheme, one cannot determine whether a coherent sheaf is a vector bundle just from its fibers (as opposed to its stalks). on a reduced locally noetherian scheme, however, a coherent sheaf is a vector bundle if and only if its rank is locally constant.

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}(1)}
   means that projective space is a fano variety. over the complex numbers, this means that projective space has a kähler metric with positive ricci curvature.

== serre construction and vector bundles ==
one useful technique for constructing rank 2 vector bundles is the serre constructionpg 3 which establishes a correspondence between rank 2 vector bundles 
  
    
      
        
          
            e

   on a smooth projective variety 
  
    
      
        x

   and codimension 2 subvarieties 
  
    
      
        y

   using a certain 
  
    
      
        
          
            ext

    {\displaystyle {\text{ext}}^{1}}
  -group calculated on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . this is given by a cohomological condition on the line bundle 
  
    
      
        
          ∧

the correspondence in one direction is given as follows: for a section

    {\displaystyle s\in \gamma (x,{\mathcal {e}})}
   we can associated the vanishing locus 
  
    
      
        v
        (
        s
        )
        ⊂

it is a local complete intersection, meaning if we take an affine chart

   is said to have the resolution property if every coherent sheaf on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has a surjection from some vector bundle on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . for example, every quasi-projective scheme over a noetherian ring has the resolution property.


=== applications of resolution property ===
since the resolution property states that a coherent sheaf 
  
    
      
        
          
            e
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {e}}}
   on a noetherian scheme is quasi-isomorphic in the derived category to the complex of vector bundles :
  
    
      
        
          
            
              e
            
          
          
            k
          
        
        →
        ⋯
        →

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {e}}_{k}\to \cdots \to {\mathcal {e}}_{1}\to {\mathcal {e}}_{0}}
  
we can compute the total chern class of

== bundle homomorphism vs. sheaf homomorphism ==
when vector bundles and locally free sheaves of finite constant rank are used interchangeably,
care must be given to distinguish between bundle homomorphisms and sheaf homomorphisms. specifically, given vector bundles 
  
    
      
        p
        :
        e
        →
        x
        ,
        
        q
        :
        f
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle p:e\to x,\,q:f\to x}
  , by definition, a bundle homomorphism 
  
    
      
        φ
        :
        e
        →
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi :e\to f}
   is a scheme morphism over 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (i.e., 
  
    
      
        p
        =
        q
        ∘
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle p=q\circ \varphi }
  ) such that, for each geometric point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            x
          
        
        :
        
          p
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        →
        
          q
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{x}:p^{-1}(x)\to q^{-1}(x)}
   is a linear map of rank independent of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . thus, it induces the sheaf homomorphism 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              φ
              ~
            
          
        
        :
        
          
            e
          
        
        →
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widetilde {\varphi }}:{\mathcal {e}}\to {\mathcal {f}}}
   of constant rank between the corresponding locally free 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
  -modules (sheaves of dual sections). but there may be an 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
  -module homomorphism that does not arise this way; namely, those not having constant rank.
in particular, a subbundle 
  
    
      
        e
        ⊂
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle e\subset f}
   is a subsheaf (i.e., 
  
    
      
        
          
            e
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {e}}}
   is a subsheaf of 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
  ). but the converse can fail; for example, for an effective cartier divisor 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
   on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
        (
        −
        d
        )
        ⊂
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}(-d)\subset {\mathcal {o}}_{x}}
   is a subsheaf but typically not a subbundle (since any line bundle has only two subbundles).


== the category of quasi-coherent sheaves ==
quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form an abelian category. gabber showed that, in fact, the quasi-coherent sheaves on any scheme form a particularly well-behaved abelian category, a grothendieck category. a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (such as an algebraic variety over a field) is determined up to isomorphism by the abelian category of quasi-coherent sheaves on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , by rosenberg, generalizing a result of gabriel.


== coherent cohomology ==

the fundamental technical tool in algebraic geometry is the cohomology theory of coherent sheaves. although it was introduced only in the 1950s, many earlier techniques of algebraic geometry are clarified by the language of sheaf cohomology applied to coherent sheaves. broadly speaking, coherent sheaf cohomology can be viewed as a tool for producing functions with specified properties; sections of line bundles or of more general sheaves can be viewed as generalized functions. in complex analytic geometry, coherent sheaf cohomology also plays a foundational role.
among the core results of coherent sheaf cohomology are results on finite-dimensionality of cohomology, results on the vanishing of cohomology in various cases, duality theorems such as serre duality, relations between topology and algebraic geometry such as hodge theory, and formulas for euler characteristics of coherent sheaves such as the riemann–roch theorem.
