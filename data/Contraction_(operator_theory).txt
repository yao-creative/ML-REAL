in operator theory, a bounded operator t: x → y between normed vector spaces x and y is said to be a contraction if its operator norm ||t || ≤ 1. every bounded operator becomes a contraction after suitable scaling. the analysis of contractions provides insight into the structure of operators, or a family of operators. the theory of contractions on hilbert space is largely due to béla szőkefalvi-nagy and ciprian foias.


== contractions on a hilbert space ==

if t is a contraction acting on a hilbert space 
  
    
      
        
          
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {h}}}
  , the following basic objects associated with t can be defined.
the defect operators of t are the operators dt = (1 − t*t)½ and dt* = (1 − tt*)½. the square root is the positive semidefinite one given by the spectral theorem. the defect spaces 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}_{t}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          
            t
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}_{t*}}
   are the closure of the ranges ran(dt) and ran(dt*) respectively. the positive operator dt induces an inner product on 
  
    
      
        
          
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {h}}}
  . the inner product space  can be identified naturally with ran(dt). a similar statement holds for 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          
            t
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}_{t*}}
  .
the defect indices of t are the pair

  
    
      
        (
        dim
        ⁡
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          
            t
          
        
        ,
        dim
        ⁡
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          
            
              t
              
                ∗
              
            
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\dim {\mathcal {d}}_{t},\dim {\mathcal {d}}_{t^{*}}).}
  the defect operators and the defect indices are a measure of the non-unitarity of t.
a contraction t on a hilbert space can be canonically decomposed into an orthogonal direct sum

  
    
      
        t
        =
        γ
        ⊕
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=\gamma \oplus u}
  where u is a unitary operator and γ is completely non-unitary in the sense that it has no non-zero reducing subspaces on which its restriction is unitary. if u = 0, t is said to be a completely non-unitary contraction. a special case of this decomposition is the wold decomposition for an isometry, where γ is a proper isometry.
contractions on hilbert spaces can be viewed as the operator analogs of cos θ and are called operator angles in some contexts. the explicit description of contractions leads to (operator-)parametrizations of positive and unitary matrices.


== dilation theorem for contractions ==
sz.-nagy's dilation theorem, proved in 1953, states that for any contraction  t on a hilbert space h, there is a unitary operator u on a larger hilbert space k ⊇ h  such that if p is the orthogonal projection of k onto h then tn = p un p for all n > 0. the operator u is called a dilation of t and is uniquely determined if u is minimal, i.e. k is the smallest closed subspace invariant under u and u* containing h.

the minimal dilation u is obtained by taking the restriction of w to the closed subspace generated by powers of w applied to h.

  using the above identification.
when g is a separable topological group, φ is continuous in the strong (or weak) operator topology if and only if u is.
in this case functions supported on a countable dense subgroup of g are dense in

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {h}}}
   is separable.
when g = z any contraction operator t defines such a function φ through

  
    
      
        
          φ
          (
          0

    {\displaystyle \displaystyle \phi (0)=i,\,\,\,\phi (n)=t^{n},\,\,\,\phi (-n)=(t^{*})^{n},}
  for n > 0. the above construction then yields a minimal unitary dilation.
the same method can be applied to prove a second dilation theorem of sz._nagy for a one-parameter strongly continuous contraction semigroup t(t) (t ≥ 0) on a hilbert space h.  cooper (1947) had previously proved the result for one-parameter semigroups of isometries,the theorem states that there is a larger hilbert space k containing h and a unitary representation u(t) of r such that

  
    
      
        
          
            t
            (
            t
            )
            =
            p
            u
            (
            t
            )
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \displaystyle {t(t)=pu(t)p}}
  and the translates u(t)h generate k.
in fact t(t) defines a continuous operator-valued positove-definite function φ on r through

  
    
      
        
          
            φ
            (
            0
            )
            =
            i
            ,
            
            
            
            φ
            (
            t
            )
            =
            t
            (
            t
            )
            ,
            
            
            
            φ
            (
            −
            t
            )
            =
            t
            (
            t
            
              )
              
                ∗
              
            
            ,
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \displaystyle {\phi (0)=i,\,\,\,\phi (t)=t(t),\,\,\,\phi (-t)=t(t)^{*},}}
  for t > 0. φ is positive-definite on cyclic subgroups of r, by the argument for z, and hence on r itself by continuity.
the previous construction yields a minimal unitary representation u(t) and projection p.
the hille-yosida theorem assigns a closed unbounded operator a to every contractive one-parameter semigroup t'(t) through

a is  called the generator of the semigroup and satisfies

  in the sense of the spectral theorem and this notation is used more generally in semigroup theory.
the cogenerator of the semigroup is the contraction defined by

  
    
      
        
          
            t
            =
            (

            +
            i
            )
            (
            a

            i
            
              )
              
                −
                1
              
            
            .
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \displaystyle {t=(a+i)(a-i)^{-1}.}}
  a can be recovered from t using the formula

  
    
      
        
          
            a
            =

            t

            i
            )
            (
            t
            −
            i
            
              )
              
                −
                1
              
            
            .
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \displaystyle {a=(t+i)(t-i)^{-1}.}}
  in particular a dilation of t on k ⊃ h immediately gives a dilation of the semigroup.

== c0 contractions ==
a completely non-unitary contraction t is said to belong to the class c0 if and only if f(t) = 0 for some non-zero
f in h∞. in this case the set of such f forms an ideal in h∞. it has the form  φ ⋅ h∞ where g 
is an inner function, i.e. such that |φ| = 1 on s1: φ is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 and is called the minimal function of t. it has properties analogous to the minimal polynomial of a matrix.
the minimal function φ admits a canonical factorization

the minimal function φ determines the spectrum of t. within the unit disk, the spectral values are the zeros of φ. there are at most countably many such λi, all eigenvalues of t, the zeros of b(z). a point of the unit circle does not lie in the spectrum of t if and only if φ has a holomorphic continuation to a neighborhood of that point.
φ reduces to a blaschke product exactly when h equals the closure of the direct sum (not necessarily orthogonal) of the generalized eigenspaces

being completely non-unitary
being in the class c0
being multiplicity free, i.e. having a commutative commutanttwo quasi-similar c0 contractions have the same minimal function and hence the same spectrum.
the classification theorem for c0 contractions states that two multiplicity free c0 contractions are quasi-similar if and only if they have the same minimal function (up to a scalar multiple).a model for multiplicity free c0 contractions with minimal function φ is given by taking

as a generalization of beurling's theorem, the commutant of such an operator consists exactly of operators ψ(t) with ψ in h≈, i.e. multiplication operators on h2 corresponding to functions in h≈.
a c0 contraction operator t is multiplicity free if and only if it is quasi-similar to a jordan block (necessarily corresponding the one corresponding to its minimal function).

the results above can be applied equally well to one-parameter semigroups, since, from the functional calculus, two semigroups are quasi-similar if and only if their cogenerators are quasi-similar.classification theorem for c0 contractions:  every c0 contraction is canonically quasi-similar to a direct sum of jordan blocks.
