in mathematics, equivariant cohomology (or borel cohomology) is a cohomology theory from algebraic topology which applies to topological spaces with a group action.  it can be viewed as a common generalization of group cohomology and an ordinary cohomology theory. specifically, the equivariant cohomology ring of a space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   with action of a topological group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is defined as the ordinary cohomology ring with coefficient ring 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   of the homotopy quotient 
  
    
      
        e
        g
        
          ×
          
            g
          
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle eg\times _{g}x}
  :

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            g
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        x
        ;
        λ
        )
        =
        
          h
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        e
        g
        
          ×
          
            g
          
        
        x
        ;
        λ
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{g}^{*}(x;\lambda )=h^{*}(eg\times _{g}x;\lambda ).}
  if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is the trivial group, this is the ordinary cohomology ring of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , whereas if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is contractible, it reduces to the cohomology ring of the classifying space 
  
    
      
        b
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle bg}
   (that is, the group cohomology of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   when g is finite.) if g acts freely on x, then the canonical map 
  
    
      
        e
        g
        
          ×
          
            g
          
        
        x
        →
        x
        
          /
        
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle eg\times _{g}x\to x/g}
   is a homotopy equivalence and so one gets: 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            g
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        x
        ;
        λ
        )
        =
        
          h
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        x
        
          /
        
        g
        ;
        λ
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{g}^{*}(x;\lambda )=h^{*}(x/g;\lambda ).}
  


== definitions ==
it is also possible to define the equivariant cohomology 

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            g
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        x
        ;
        a
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{g}^{*}(x;a)}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   with coefficients in a 

  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -module a; these are abelian groups. 
this construction is the analogue of cohomology with local coefficients.
if x is a manifold, g a compact lie group and 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers (the most typical situation), then the above cohomology may be computed using the so-called cartan model (see equivariant differential forms.)
the construction should not be confused with other cohomology theories,
such as bredon cohomology or the cohomology of invariant differential forms: if g is a compact lie group, then, by the averaging argument, any form may be made invariant; thus, cohomology of invariant differential forms does not yield new information.
koszul duality is known to hold between equivariant cohomology and ordinary cohomology.

== homotopy quotient ==
the homotopy quotient, also called homotopy orbit space or borel construction, is a “homotopically correct” version of the orbit space (the quotient of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   by its 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -action) in which 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is first replaced by a larger but homotopy equivalent space so that the action is guaranteed to be free.
to this end, construct the universal bundle eg → bg for g and recall that eg admits a free g-action.  then the product eg × x —which is homotopy equivalent to x since eg is contractible—admits a “diagonal” g-action defined by (e,x).g = (eg,g−1x): moreover, this diagonal action is free since it is free on eg.  so we define the homotopy quotient xg to be the orbit space (eg × x)/g of this free g-action.
in other words, the homotopy quotient is the associated x-bundle over bg obtained from the action of g on a space x and the principal bundle eg → bg. this bundle x → xg → bg is called the borel fibration.


== an example of a homotopy quotient ==
the following example is proposition 1 of [1].
let x be a complex projective algebraic curve. we identify x as a topological space with the set of the complex points 
  
    
      
        x
        (
        
          c
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x(\mathbb {c} )}
  , which is a compact riemann surface. let g be a complex simply connected semisimple lie group. then any principal g-bundle on x is isomorphic to a trivial bundle, since the classifying space 
  
    
      
        b
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle bg}
   is 2-connected and x has real dimension 2. fix some smooth g-bundle 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            sm
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\text{sm}}}
   on x. then any principal g-bundle on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is isomorphic to 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            sm
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\text{sm}}}
  . in other words, the set 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   of all isomorphism classes of pairs consisting of a principal g-bundle on x and a complex-analytic structure on it can be identified with the set of complex-analytic structures on 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            sm
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\text{sm}}}
   or equivalently the set of holomorphic connections on x (since connections are integrable for dimension reason). 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   is an infinite-dimensional complex affine space and is therefore contractible.
let 
  
    
      
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {g}}}
   be the group of all automorphisms of 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            sm
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\text{sm}}}
   (i.e., gauge group.) then the homotopy quotient of 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   by 
  
    
      
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {g}}}
   classifies complex-analytic (or equivalently algebraic) principal g-bundles on x; i.e., it is precisely the classifying space 
  
    
      
        b
        
          
            g

            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {g}}}

one can define the moduli stack of principal bundles 
  
    
      
        
          bun
          
            g

        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {bun} _{g}(x)}
   as the quotient stack 
  
    
      
        [
        ω
        
          /
        
        
          
            g
          
        
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [\omega /{\mathcal {g}}]}
   and then the homotopy quotient 
  
    
      
        b
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle b{\mathcal {g}}}
   is, by definition, the homotopy type of 
  
    
      
        
          bun
          
            g

        x

== equivariant characteristic classes ==
let e be an equivariant vector bundle on a g-manifold m. it gives rise to a vector bundle 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              e
              ~
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widetilde {e}}}
   on the homotopy quotient 
  
    
      
        e
        g
        
          ×
          
            g
          
        
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle eg\times _{g}m}
   so that it pulls-back to the bundle 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              e
              ~
            
          
        
        =
        e
        g
        ×
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widetilde {e}}=eg\times e}
   over 
  
    
      
        e
        g
        ×
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle eg\times m}
  . an equivariant characteristic class of e is then an ordinary characteristic class of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              e
              ~
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widetilde {e}}}
  , which is an element of the completion of the cohomology ring 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        e
        g
        
          ×
          
            g
          
        
        m
        )
        =
        
          h
          
            g
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{*}(eg\times _{g}m)=h_{g}^{*}(m)}
  . (in order to apply chern–weil theory, one uses a finite-dimensional approximation of eg.)
alternatively, one can first define an equivariant chern class and then define other characteristic classes as invariant polynomials of chern classes as in the ordinary case; for example, the equivariant todd class of an equivariant line bundle is the todd function evaluated at the equivariant first chern class of the bundle. (an equivariant todd class of a line bundle is a power series (not a polynomial as in the non-equivariant case) in the equivariant first chern class; hence, it belongs to the completion of the equivariant cohomology ring.)
in the non-equivariant case, the first chern class can be viewed as a bijection between the set of all isomorphism classes of complex line bundles on a manifold m and 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            2
          
        
        (
        m
        ;
        
          z
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{2}(m;\mathbb {z} ).}
   in the equivariant case, this translates to: the equivariant first chern gives a bijection between the set of all isomorphism classes of equivariant complex line bundles and 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            g
          
          
            2
          
        
        (
        m
        ;
        
          z
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{g}^{2}(m;\mathbb {z} )}
  .
