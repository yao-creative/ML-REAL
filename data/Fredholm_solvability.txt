in mathematics, fredholm solvability encompasses results and techniques for solving differential and integral equations via the fredholm alternative and, more generally, the fredholm-type properties of the operator involved. the concept is named after erik ivar fredholm.
let a be a real n × n-matrix and 
  
    
      
        b
        ∈
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\in \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   a vector.
the fredholm alternative in 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   states that the equation 
  
    
      
        a
        x
        =
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle ax=b}
   has a solution if and only if 
  
    
      
        
          b
          
            t
          
        
        v
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle b^{t}v=0}
   for every vector 
  
    
      
        v
        ∈
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v\in \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   satisfying 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            t
          
        
        v
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{t}v=0}
  . this alternative has many applications, for example, in bifurcation theory. it can be generalized to abstract spaces. so, let 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   and

  , denote the topological dual of 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
  , respectively 
  
    
      
        f

  , and let

            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t^{*}}
   denote the adjoint of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   (cf. also duality; adjoint operator). define

    {\displaystyle (\ker t^{*})^{\perp }=\{y\in f:(y,y^{*})=0{\text{ for every }}y^{*}\in \ker t^{*}\}}
  an equation 
  
    
      
        t
        x
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle tx=y}
   is said to be normally solvable (in the sense of f. hausdorff) if it has a solution whenever 
  
    
      
        y
        ∈
        (
        ker
        ⁡

            ⊥
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y\in (\ker t^{*})^{\perp }}
  . a classical result states that 
  
    
      
        t
        x
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle tx=y}
   is normally solvable if and only if 
  
    
      
        t
        (
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle t(e)}
   is closed in 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  .
in non-linear analysis, this latter result is used as definition of normal solvability for non-linear operators.
