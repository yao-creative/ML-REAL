the hahn–banach theorem is a central tool in functional analysis. 
it allows the extension of bounded linear functionals defined on a subspace of some vector space to the whole space, and it also shows that there are "enough" continuous linear functionals defined on every normed vector space to make the study of the dual space "interesting". another version of the hahn–banach theorem is known as the hahn–banach separation theorem or the hyperplane separation theorem, and has numerous uses in convex geometry.

the theorem is named for the mathematicians hans hahn and stefan banach, who proved it independently in the late 1920s. 
the special case of the theorem for the space 
  
    
      
        c
        [
        a
        ,
        b
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle c[a,b]}
   of continuous functions on an interval was proved earlier (in 1912) by eduard helly, and a more general extension theorem, the m. riesz extension theorem, from which the hahn–banach theorem can be derived, was proved in 1923 by marcel riesz.the first hahn–banach theorem was proved by eduard helly in 1921 who showed that certain linear functionals defined on a subspace of a certain type of normed space (
  
    
      
        
          
            c
          
          
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} ^{\mathbb {n} }}
  ) had an extension of the same norm. helly did this through the technique of first proving that a one-dimensional extension exists (where the linear functional has its domain extended by one dimension) and then using induction.  in 1927, hahn defined general banach spaces and used helly's technique to prove a norm-preserving version of hahn–banach theorem for banach spaces (where a bounded linear functional on a subspace has a bounded linear extension of the same norm to the whole space).  in 1929, banach, who was unaware of hahn's result, generalized it by replacing the norm-preserving version with the dominated extension version that uses sublinear functions.  whereas helly's proof used mathematical induction, hahn and banach both used transfinite induction.the hahn–banach theorem arose from attempts to solve infinite systems of linear equations. this is needed to solve problems such as the moment problem, whereby given all the potential moments of a function one must determine if a function having these moments exists, and, if so, find it in terms of those moments. another such problem is the fourier cosine series problem, whereby given all the potential fourier cosine coefficients one must determine if a function having those coefficients exists, and, again, find it if so.
riesz and helly solved the problem for certain classes of spaces (such as 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            p

   and 
  
    
      
        c
        (

        a

        b
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c([a,b])}
   where they discovered that the existence of a solution was equivalent to the existence and continuity of certain linear functionals.  in effect, they needed to solve the following problem:

   spaces in 1913.  while investigating these spaces he proved a special case of the hahn–banach theorem.  helly also proved a special case of the hahn–banach theorem in 1912.  in 1910, riesz solved the functional problem for some specific spaces and in 1912, helly solved it for a more general class of spaces. it wasn't until 1932 that banach, in one of the first important applications of the hahn–banach theorem, solved the general functional problem.  the following theorem states the general functional problem and characterizes its solution.

the hahn–banach theorem can be deduced from the above theorem. if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is reflexive then this theorem solves the vector problem.

every norm is a seminorm and both are symmetric sublinear functions. on a real vector space (although not on a complex vector space), a sublinear function is a seminorm if and only if it is symmetric. the identity function

   is an example of a sublinear function that is not a seminorm.

with this terminology, the above statements of the hahn–banach theorem can be restated more succinctly:

        x
        ,

the following observations allow the hahn–banach theorem for real vector spaces to be applied to (complex-valued) linear functionals on complex vector spaces.

in particular, a linear functional on

stated in plain english, a linear functional is dominated by a seminorm

continuity
a linear functional 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   on a topological vector space  is continuous if and only if this is true of its real part 
  
    
      
        re
        ⁡
        f
        ;
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {re} f;}
   if the domain is a normed space then 
  
    
      
        ‖
        f
        ‖
        =
        ‖

        ⁡
        f
        ‖
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|f\|=\|\operatorname {re} f\|}
   (where one side is infinite if and only if the other side is infinite). 
assume 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a topological vector space and 
  
    
      
        p
        :
        x
        →
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p:x\to \mathbb {r} }
   is sublinear function. 
if 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is a continuous sublinear function that dominates a linear functional 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   then 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is necessarily continuous. moreover, a linear functional 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is continuous if and only if its absolute value 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        f
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |f|}
   (which is a seminorm that dominates 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  ) is continuous. in particular, a linear functional is continuous if and only if it is dominated by some continuous sublinear function.


=== proof ===
the hahn–banach theorem for real vector spaces ultimately follows from helly's initial result for the special case where the linear functional is extended from 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   to a larger vector space in which 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   has codimension 
  
    
      
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1.}
  

the lemma above is the key step in deducing the dominated extension theorem from zorn's lemma. this lemma remains true if 
  
    
      
        p
        :
        x
        →
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p:x\to \mathbb {r} }
   is merely a convex function instead of a sublinear function.

the mizar project has completely formalized and automatically checked the proof of the hahn–banach theorem in the hahnban file.


=== in locally convex spaces ===
in the above form, the functional to be extended must already be bounded by a sublinear function.  in some applications, this might close to begging the question.  however, in locally convex spaces, any continuous functional is already bounded by the norm, which is sublinear.  one thus hasin category-theoretic terms, the field 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {k} }
   is an injective object in the category of locally convex vector spaces.


== geometric hahn–banach (the hahn–banach separation theorems) ==

the key element of the hahn–banach theorem is fundamentally a result about the separation of two convex sets: 
  
    
      
        {
        −
        p
        (
        −
        x
        −
        n
        )
        −
        f
        (
        n
        )
        :
        n
        ∈
        m
        }
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{-p(-x-n)-f(n):n\in m\},}
   and 
  
    
      
        {
        p
        (
        m
        +
        x
        )
        −
        f
        (
        m
        )
        :
        m
        ∈
        m
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{p(m+x)-f(m):m\in m\}.}
    this sort of argument appears widely in convex geometry, optimization theory, and economics.  lemmas to this end derived from the original hahn–banach theorem are known as the hahn–banach separation theorems.

when the convex sets have additional properties, such as being open or compact for example, then the conclusion can be substantially strengthened:

then following important corollary is known as the geometric hahn–banach theorem or mazur's theorem. it follows from the first bullet above and the convexity of 
  
    
      
        m
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m.}
   

mazur's theorem clarifies that vector subspaces (even those that are not closed) can be characterized by linear functionals. 


=== supporting hyperplanes ===
since points are trivially convex, geometric hahn-banach implies that functionals can detect the boundary of a set.  in particular, let 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   be a real topological vector space and 
  
    
      
        a
        ⊆
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\subseteq x}
   be convex with 
  
    
      
        int
        ⁡
        a
        ≠
        ∅
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {int} a\neq \varnothing .}
   if 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            0
          
        
        ∈
        a

        int
        ⁡
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{0}\in a\setminus \operatorname {int} a}
   then there is a functional that is vanishing at 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            0
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{0},}
   but supported on the interior of 
  
    
      
        a
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a.}
  call a normed space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   smooth if at each point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in its unit ball there exists a unique closed hyperplane to the unit ball at 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   köthe showed in 1983 that a normed space is smooth at a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   if and only if the norm is gateaux differentiable at that point.


=== balanced or disked neighborhoods ===
let 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   be a convex balanced neighborhood of the origin in a locally convex topological vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and suppose

    {\displaystyle x\in x}

        u
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle u.}
   then there exists a continuous linear functional 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}

    {\displaystyle \sup |f(u)|\leq |f(x)|.}
  


== applications ==
the hahn–banach theorem is the first sign of an important philosophy in functional analysis: to understand a space, one should understand its continuous functionals.
for example, linear subspaces are characterized by functionals: if x is a normed vector space with linear subspace m (not necessarily closed) and if 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   is an element of x not in the closure of m, then there exists a continuous linear map 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:x\to \mathbf {k} }
   with 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        m
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(m)=0}
   for all 
  
    
      
        m
        ∈
        m
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\in m,}
   
  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)=1,}
   and 
  
    
      
        ‖
        f
        ‖
        =
        dist
        ⁡
        (
        z
        ,
        m
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|f\|=\operatorname {dist} (z,m)^{-1}.}
    (to see this, note that 
  
    
      
        dist
        ⁡
        (
        ⋅
        ,
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {dist} (\cdot ,m)}
   is a sublinear function.)  moreover, if 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   is an element of x, then there exists a continuous linear map 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:x\to \mathbf {k} }
   such that 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        ‖
        z
        ‖
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)=\|z\|}
   and 
  
    
      
        ‖
        f
        ‖
        ≤
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|f\|\leq 1.}
    this implies that the natural injection 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   from a normed space x into its double dual 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            ∗
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v^{**}}
   is isometric.
that last result also suggests that the hahn–banach theorem can often be used to locate a "nicer" topology in which to work.  for example, many results in functional analysis assume that a space is hausdorff or locally convex.  however, suppose x is a topological vector space, not necessarily hausdorff or locally convex, but with a nonempty, proper, convex, open set m.  then geometric hahn-banach implies that there is a hyperplane separating m from any other point.  in particular, there must exist a nonzero functional on x — that is, the continuous dual space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{*}}
   is non-trivial. considering x with the weak topology induced by 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∗
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{*},}
   then x becomes locally convex; by the second bullet of geometric hahn-banach, the weak topology on this new space separates points. 
thus x with this weak topology becomes hausdorff.  this sometimes allows some results from locally convex topological vector spaces to be applied to non-hausdorff and non-locally convex spaces.


=== partial differential equations ===
the hahn–banach theorem is often useful when one wishes to apply the method of a priori estimates.  suppose that we wish to solve the linear differential equation 
  
    
      
        p
        u
        =
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle pu=f}
   for 
  
    
      
        u
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle u,}
   with 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   given in some banach space x.  if we have control on the size of 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   in terms of 
  
    
      
        ‖
        f
        
          ‖
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|f\|_{x}}
   and we can think of 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   as a bounded linear functional on some suitable space of test functions 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   then we can view 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   as a linear functional by adjunction: 
  
    
      
        (
        f
        ,
        g
        )
        =
        (
        u
        ,
        
          p
          
            ∗
          
        
        g
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (f,g)=(u,p^{*}g).}
    at first, this functional is only defined on the image of 
  
    
      
        p
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle p,}
   but using the hahn–banach theorem, we can try to extend it to the entire codomain x.  the resulting functional is often defined to be a weak solution to the equation.


=== characterizing reflexive banach spaces ===


=== example from fredholm theory ===
to illustrate an actual application of the hahn–banach theorem, we will now prove a result that follows almost entirely from the hahn–banach theorem.

the above result may be used to show that every closed vector subspace of 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{\mathbb {n} }}
   is complemented because any such space is either finite dimensional or else tvs–isomorphic to 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            
              n
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{\mathbb {n} }.}

general template
there are now many other versions of the hahn–banach theorem. the general template for the various versions of the hahn–banach theorem presented in this article is as follows:

=== vector valued hahn–banach ===


=== for nonlinear functions ===
the following theorem of mazur–orlicz (1953) is equivalent to the hahn–banach theorem.

the following theorem characterizes when any scalar function on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (not necessarily linear) has a continuous linear extension to all of 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
  


== converse ==
let x be a topological vector space.  a vector subspace m of x has the extension property if any continuous linear functional on m can be extended to a continuous linear functional on x, and we say that x has the hahn–banach extension property (hbep) if every vector subspace of x has the extension property.the hahn–banach theorem guarantees that every hausdorff locally convex space has the hbep.  for complete metrizable topological vector spaces there is a converse, due to kalton: every complete metrizable tvs with the hahn–banach extension property is locally convex.  on the other hand, a vector space x of uncountable dimension, endowed with the finest vector topology, then this is a topological vector spaces with the hahn-banach extension property that is neither locally convex nor metrizable.a vector subspace m of a tvs x has the separation property if for every element of x such that 
  
    
      
        x
        ∉
        m
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\not \in m,}
   there exists a continuous linear functional 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   on x such that 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)\neq 0}
   and 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        m
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(m)=0}
   for all 
  
    
      
        m
        ∈
        m
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\in m.}
    clearly, the continuous dual space of a tvs x separates points on x if and only if 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        }
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0\},}
   has the separation property.  in 1992, kakol proved that any infinite dimensional vector space x, there exist tvs-topologies on x that do not have the hbep despite having enough continuous linear functionals for the continuous dual space to separate points on x.  however, if x is a tvs then every vector subspace of x has the extension property if and only if every vector subspace of x has the separation property.


== relation to axiom of choice and other theorems ==

the proof of the hahn–banach theorem commonly uses zorn's lemma, which in the axiomatic framework of zermelo–fraenkel set theory (zf) is equivalent to the axiom of choice (ac).  it is now known (see below) that the ultrafilter lemma (or equivalently, the boolean prime ideal theorem), which is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice, is sufficient to prove the hahn–banach theorem for real vector spaces (hb). 
the ultrafilter lemma is equivalent (under zf) to the banach–alaoglu theorem, which is another foundational theorem in functional analysis. although the banach–alaoglu theorem implies hb, it is not equivalent to it (said differently, the banach–alaoglu theorem is strictly stronger than hb). 
however, hb is equivalent to a certain weakened version of the banach–alaoglu theorem for normed spaces. 
the hahn–banach theorem is also equivalent to the following statement:
(∗): on every boolean algebra b there exists a "probability charge", that is: a nonconstant finitely additive map from b into 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        1
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1].}
  (the boolean prime ideal theorem is equivalent to the statement that there are always nonconstant probability charges which take only the values 0 and 1.)
in zf, the hahn–banach theorem suffices to derive the existence of a non-lebesgue measurable set.  moreover, the hahn–banach theorem implies the banach–tarski paradox.for separable banach spaces, d. k. brown and s. g. simpson proved that the hahn–banach theorem follows from wkl0, a weak subsystem of second-order arithmetic that takes a form of kőnig's lemma restricted to binary trees as an axiom.  in fact, they prove that under a weak set of assumptions, the two are equivalent, an example of reverse mathematics.
