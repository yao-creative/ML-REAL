in mathematics, a principal bundle is a mathematical object that formalizes some of the essential features of the cartesian product 
  
    
      
        x
        ×
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\times g}
   of a space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   with a group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  . in the same way as with the cartesian product, a principal bundle 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is equipped with

an action of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   on 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  , analogous to 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        g
        )
        h
        =
        (
        x
        ,
        g
        h
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,g)h=(x,gh)}
   for a product space.
a projection onto 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . for a product space, this is just the projection onto the first factor, 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        g
        )
        ↦
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,g)\mapsto x}
  .unlike a product space, principal bundles lack a preferred choice of identity cross-section; they have no preferred analog of 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,e)}
  . likewise, there is not generally a projection onto 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   generalizing the projection onto the second factor, 
  
    
      
        x
        ×
        g
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\times g\to g}
   that exists for the cartesian product. they may also have a complicated topology that prevents them from being realized as a product space even if a number of arbitrary choices are made to try to define such a structure by defining it on smaller pieces of the space.
a common example of a principal bundle is the frame bundle 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(e)}
   of a vector bundle 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
  , which consists of all ordered bases of the vector space attached to each point.  the group 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   in this case, is the general linear group, which acts on the right in the usual way: by changes of basis.  since there is no natural way to choose an ordered basis of a vector space, a frame bundle lacks a canonical choice of identity cross-section.
principal bundles have important applications in topology and differential geometry and mathematical gauge theory. they have also found application in physics where they form part of the foundational framework of physical gauge theories.

        g

   such that 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   preserves the fibers of 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   (i.e. if 
  
    
      
        y
        ∈
        
          p

    {\displaystyle y\in p_{x}}
   then

    {\displaystyle yg\in p_{x}}
   for all 
  
    
      
        g
        ∈
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\in g}
  ) and acts freely and transitively (i.e. regularly) on them in such a way that for each 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
        ∈
        
          p
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y\in p_{x}}
  , the map 
  
    
      
        g
        →
        
          p
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\to p_{x}}
   sending 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   to 
  
    
      
        y
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle yg}
   is a homeomorphism. in particular each fiber of the bundle is homeomorphic to the group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   itself. frequently, one requires the base space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to be hausdorff and possibly paracompact.
since the group action preserves the fibers of 
  
    
      
        π
        :
        p
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi :p\to x}
   and acts transitively, it follows that the orbits of the 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -action are precisely these fibers and the orbit space 
  
    
      
        p
        
          /
        
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle p/g}
   is homeomorphic to the base space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . because the action is free, the fibers have the structure of g-torsors. a 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -torsor is a space that is homeomorphic to 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   but lacks a group structure since there is no preferred choice of an identity element.
an equivalent definition of a principal 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -bundle is as a 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -bundle 
  
    
      
        π
        :
        p
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi :p\to x}
   with fiber 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   where the structure group acts on the fiber by left multiplication. since right multiplication by 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   on the fiber commutes with the action of the structure group, there exists an invariant notion of right multiplication by 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   on 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  . the fibers of 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   then become right 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -torsors for this action.
the definitions above are for arbitrary topological spaces. one can also define principal 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -bundles in the category of smooth manifolds. here 
  
    
      
        π
        :
        p
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi :p\to x}
   is required to be a smooth map between smooth manifolds, 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is required to be a lie group, and the corresponding action on 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   should be smooth.

the prototypical example of a smooth principal bundle is the frame bundle of a smooth manifold 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  , often denoted 
  
    
      
        f
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle fm}
   or 
  
    
      
        g

        (

    {\displaystyle x\in m}
   is the set of all frames (i.e. ordered bases) for the tangent space 
  
    
      
        
          t

          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle gl(n,\mathbb {r} )}
   acts freely and transitively on these frames. these fibers can be glued together in a natural way so as to obtain a principal 
  
    
      
        g
        l
        (
        n
        ,

    {\displaystyle m}
  .
variations on the above example include the orthonormal frame bundle of a riemannian manifold. here the frames are required to be orthonormal with respect to the metric. the structure group is the orthogonal group 
  
    
      
        o
        (
        n
        )

        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is any vector bundle of rank

    {\displaystyle k}
   over 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  , then the bundle of frames of 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is a principal

projective spaces provide some more interesting examples of principal bundles. recall that the

=== trivializations and cross sections ===
one of the most important questions regarding any fiber bundle is whether or not it is trivial, i.e. isomorphic to a product bundle. for principal bundles there is a convenient characterization of triviality:

proposition. a principal bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a global section.the same is not true for other fiber bundles. for instance, vector bundles always have a zero section whether they are trivial or not and sphere bundles may admit many global sections without being trivial.
the same fact applies to local trivializations of principal bundles. let π : p → x be a principal g-bundle. an open set u in x admits a local trivialization if and only if there exists a local section on u. given a local trivialization

  
    
      
        φ
        :
        
          π
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        u
        )
        →
        u
        ×
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :\pi ^{-1}(u)\to u\times g}
  one can define an associated local section 

  
    
      
        s
        :
        u
        →
        
          π
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        u
        )
        ;
        s
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          φ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        e
        )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s:u\to \pi ^{-1}(u);s(x)=\phi ^{-1}(x,e)\,}
  where e is the identity in g. conversely, given a section s one defines a trivialization φ by

  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        g
        )
        =
        s
        (
        x
        )
        ⋅
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi ^{-1}(x,g)=s(x)\cdot g.}
  the simple transitivity of the g action  on the fibers of p guarantees that this map is a bijection, it is also a homeomorphism. the local trivializations defined by local sections are g-equivariant in the following sense. if we write

  
    
      
        φ
        :
        
          π
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        u
        )
        →
        u
        ×
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :\pi ^{-1}(u)\to u\times g}
  in the form 

  
    
      
        φ
        (
        p
        )
        =
        (
        π
        (
        p
        )
        ,
        φ
        (
        p
        )
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi (p)=(\pi (p),\varphi (p)),}
  then the map

  
    
      
        φ
        :
        p
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi :p\to g}
  satisfies

  
    
      
        φ
        (
        p
        ⋅
        g
        )
        =
        φ
        (
        p
        )
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi (p\cdot g)=\varphi (p)g.}
  equivariant trivializations therefore preserve the g-torsor structure of the fibers. in terms of the associated local section s the map φ is given by

  
    
      
        φ
        (
        s
        (
        x
        )
        ⋅
        g
        )
        =
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi (s(x)\cdot g)=g.}
  the local version of the cross section theorem then states that the equivariant local trivializations of a principal bundle are in one-to-one correspondence with local sections.
given an equivariant local trivialization ({ui}, {φi}) of p, we have local sections si on each ui. on overlaps these must be related by the action of the structure group g. in fact, the relationship is provided by the transition functions

  
    
      
        
          t
          
            i
            j
          
        
        :
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        ∩
        
          u
          
            j
          
        
        →
        g
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{ij}:u_{i}\cap u_{j}\to g\,.}
  by gluing the local trivializations together using these transition functions, one may reconstruct the original principal bundle. this is an example of the fiber bundle construction theorem.
for any x ∈ ui ∩ uj we have

  
    
      
        
          s
          
            j
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          s
          
            i
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        ⋅
        
          t
          
            i
            j
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{j}(x)=s_{i}(x)\cdot t_{ij}(x).}
  


=== characterization of smooth principal bundles ===
if 
  
    
      
        π
        :
        p
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi :p\to x}
   is a smooth principal 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -bundle then 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   acts freely and properly on 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   so that the orbit space 
  
    
      
        p
        
          /
        
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle p/g}
   is diffeomorphic to the base space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . it turns out that these properties completely characterize smooth principal bundles. that is, if 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is a smooth manifold,

    {\displaystyle g}

    {\displaystyle \mu :p\times g\to p}
   a smooth, free, and proper right action then

  
    
      
        p
        
          /
        
        g

the natural projection 
  
    
      
        π

        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle p/g}
  .


== use of the notion ==


=== reduction of the structure group ===

given a subgroup h of g one may consider the  bundle 
  
    
      
        p
        
          /
        
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle p/h}
   whose fibers are homeomorphic to the coset space 
  
    
      
        g
        
          /
        
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle g/h}
  .  if the new bundle admits a global section, then one says that the section is a reduction of the structure group from 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   to 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   .  the reason for this name is that the (fiberwise) inverse image of the values of this section form a subbundle of 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   that is a principal 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
  -bundle. if 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is the identity, then a section of 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   itself is a reduction of the structure group to the identity. reductions of the structure group do not in general exist.
many topological questions about the structure of a manifold or the structure of bundles over it that are associated to a principal 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -bundle may be rephrased as questions about the admissibility of the reduction of the structure group (from 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   to 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
  ). for example:

a 
  
    
      
        2
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2n}
  -dimensional real manifold admits an almost-complex structure if the frame bundle on the manifold, whose fibers are 
  
    
      
        g
        l
        (
        2
        n

=== associated vector bundles and frames ===

   is a linear representation of 
  
    
      
        g

   with fibre

    {\displaystyle v}
  , as the quotient of the product

  ×

        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is called an associated vector bundle to

== classification of principal bundles ==

any topological group g admits a classifying space bg: the quotient by the action of g of some weakly contractible space eg, i.e. a topological space with vanishing homotopy groups. the classifying space has the property that any g principal bundle over a paracompact manifold b is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle eg → bg. in fact, more is true, as the set of isomorphism classes of principal g bundles over the base b identifies with the set of homotopy classes of maps b → bg.
