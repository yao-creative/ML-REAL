in number theory, the partition function p(n) represents the number of possible partitions of a non-negative integer n. for instance, p(4) = 5 because the integer 4 has the five partitions 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 2, 1 + 3, 2 + 2, and 4.
no closed-form expression for the partition function is known, but it has both asymptotic expansions that accurately approximate it and recurrence relations by which it can be calculated exactly. it grows as an exponential function of the square root of its argument. the multiplicative inverse of its generating function is the euler function; by euler's pentagonal number theorem this function is an alternating sum of pentagonal number powers of its argument.
srinivasa ramanujan first discovered that the partition function has nontrivial patterns in modular arithmetic, now known as ramanujan's congruences. for instance, whenever the decimal representation of n ends in the digit 4 or 9, the number of partitions of n will be divisible by 5.


== definition and examples ==
for a positive integer n, p(n) is the number of distinct ways of representing n as a sum of positive integers. for the purposes of this definition, the order of the terms in the sum is irrelevant: two sums with the same terms in a different order are not considered to be distinct.
by convention p(0) = 1, as there is one way (the empty sum) of representing zero as a sum of positive integers. furthermore p(n) = 0 when n is negative.
the first few values of the partition function, starting with p(0) = 1, are:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, 56, 77, 101, 135, 176, 231, 297, 385, 490, 627, 792, 1002, 1255, 1575, 1958, 2436, 3010, 3718, 4565, 5604, ... (sequence a000041 in the oeis).some exact values of p(n) for larger values of n include:
as of february 2020, the largest known prime number among the values of p(n) is p(1289844341), with 40,000 decimal digits; this is also the largest prime that has been proved using elliptic curve primality proving.


== generating function ==

the generating function for p(n) is given by
the equality between the products on the first and second lines of this formula
is obtained by expanding each factor 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        (
        1
        −
        
          x
          
            k
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/(1-x^{k})}
   into the geometric series 
  
    
      
        (
        1
        +
        
          x
          
            k
          
        
        +
        
          x
          
            2
            k
          
        
        +
        
          x
          
            3
            k
          
        
        +
        ⋯
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (1+x^{k}+x^{2k}+x^{3k}+\cdots ).}
  
to see that the expanded product equals the sum on the first line,
apply the distributive law to the product. this expands the product into a sum of monomials of the form 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            
              a
              
                1
              
            
          
        
        
          x
          
            2
            
              a
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        
          x
          
            3
            
              a
              
                3
              
            
          
        
        ⋯
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{a_{1}}x^{2a_{2}}x^{3a_{3}}\cdots }
   for some sequence of coefficients

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{i}}
  , only finitely many of which can be non-zero.
the exponent of the term is 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        ∑
        i
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=\sum ia_{i}}
  , and this sum can be interpreted
as a representation of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   as a partition into 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{i}}
   copies of each number 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  . therefore, the number of terms of the product that have exponent 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is exactly 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(n)}
  , the same
as the coefficient of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{n}}
   in the sum on the left.
therefore, the sum equals the product.
the function that appears in the denominator in the third and fourth lines of the formula is the euler function. the equality between the product on the first line and the formulas in the third and fourth lines is euler's pentagonal number theorem.
the exponents of 
  
    
      
        x

   in these lines are the pentagonal numbers

        …
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\in \{0,1,-1,2,-2,\dots \}}
   (generalized somewhat from the usual pentagonal numbers, which come from the same formula for the positive values of 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  ). the pattern of positive and negative signs in the third line comes from the term 
  
    
      
        (
        −
        1
        
          )
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-1)^{k}}
   in the fourth line: even choices of 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   produce positive terms, and odd choices produce negative terms.
more generally, the generating function for the partitions of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   into numbers selected from a set 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   of positive integers can be found by taking only those terms in the first product for which 
  
    
      
        k
        ∈
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\in a}
  . this result is due to leonhard euler. the formulation of euler's generating function is a special case of a 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
  -pochhammer symbol and is similar to the product formulation of many modular forms, and specifically the dedekind eta function.

== congruences ==

srinivasa ramanujan is credited with discovering that the partition function has nontrivial patterns in modular arithmetic.
for instance the number of partitions is divisible by five whenever the decimal representation of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   ends in the digit 4 or 9, as expressed by the congruence

  
    
      
        p
        (
        5
        k
        +
        4
        )
        ≡
        0
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          5
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(5k+4)\equiv 0{\pmod {5}}}
  for instance, the number of partitions for the integer 4 is 5. 
for the integer 9, the number of partitions is 30; for 14 there are 135 partitions. this congruence is implied by the more general identity

  
    
      
        
          ∑

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x)_{\infty }=\prod _{m=1}^{\infty }(1-x^{m}).}
  a short proof of this result can be obtained from the partition function generating function.
ramanujan also discovered congruences modulo 7 and 11:

                5
                )

                  mod
                  
                  7
                  )
                
                ,
              
            
            
              
                p
                (
                11
                k
                +
                6
                )

    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p(7k+5)&\equiv 0{\pmod {7}},\\p(11k+6)&\equiv 0{\pmod {11}}.\end{aligned}}}

  since 5, 7, and 11 are consecutive primes, one might think that there would be an analogous congruence for the next prime 13, 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        13
        k
        +
        a
        )
        ≡
        0
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          13
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(13k+a)\equiv 0{\pmod {13}}}
   for some a. however, there is no congruence of the form 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        b
        k
        +
        a
        )
        ≡
        0
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          b
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(bk+a)\equiv 0{\pmod {b}}}
   for any prime b other than 5, 7, or 11. instead, to obtain a congruence, the argument of 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   should take the form 
  
    
      
        c
        b
        k
        +
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle cbk+a}
   for some 
  
    
      
        c
        >
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle c>1}
  . in the 1960s, a. o. l. atkin of the university of illinois at chicago discovered additional congruences of this form for small prime moduli. for example:

  
    
      
        p
        (
        
          11
          
            3
          
        
        ⋅
        13
        ⋅
        k
        +
        237
        )
        ≡
        0
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          13
          )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(11^{3}\cdot 13\cdot k+237)\equiv 0{\pmod {13}}.}
  ken ono (2000) proved that there are such congruences for every prime modulus greater than 3. later, ahlgren & ono (2001) showed there are partition congruences modulo every integer coprime to 6.
