for simplicity, a reference to the base scheme is often omitted; i.e., a scheme will be a scheme over some fixed base scheme s and a morphism an s-morphism.

f(n), f(d)
1.  if x is a projective scheme with serre's twisting sheaf 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o

        (

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{x}(1)}
   and if f is an 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o

                  o
                
              
              
                x

              o

  -module (x arbitrary), then

        d
        )
        =

            x
          
        
        (
        d
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(d)=f\otimes _{{\mathcal {o}}_{x}}{\mathcal {o}}_{x}(d).}
   if d is a weil divisor and f is reflexive, then one replaces f(d) by its reflexive hull (and call the result still f(d).)

|d|
the complete linear system of a weil divisor d on a normal complete variety x over an algebraically closed field k; that is, 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        d
        
          |
        
        =
        
          p
        
        (
        γ
        (
        x
        ,
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
        (
        d
        )
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle |d|=\mathbf {p} (\gamma (x,{\mathcal {o}}_{x}(d)))}
  . there is a bijection between the set of k-rational points of |d| and the set of effective weil divisors on x that are linearly equivalent to d. the same definition is used if d is a cartier divisor on a complete variety over k.

[x/g]
the quotient stack of, say, an algebraic space x by an action of a group scheme g.

  
    
      
        x
        
          /
        
        
        
          /
        
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle x/\!/g}

p(v)
the notation is ambiguous. its traditional meaning is the projectivization of a finite-dimensional k-vector space v; i.e.,

  
    
      
        
          p
        
        (
        v

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} (v)=\operatorname {proj} (k[v])=\operatorname {proj} (\operatorname {sym} (v^{*}))}
  
(the proj of the ring of polynomial functions k[v]) and its k-points correspond to lines in v. in contrast, hartshorne and ega write p(v) for the proj of the symmetric algebra of v.

affine
1.  affine space is roughly a vector space where one has forgotten which point is the origin 
2.  an affine variety is a variety in affine space
3.  an affine scheme is a scheme that is the prime spectrum of some commutative ring.
4.  a morphism is called affine if the preimage of any open affine subset is again affine. in more fancy terms, affine morphisms are defined by the global spec construction for sheaves of ox-algebras, defined by analogy with the spectrum of a ring. important affine morphisms are vector bundles, and finite morphisms.
5.  the affine cone over a closed subvariety x of a projective space is the spec of the homogeneous coordinate ring of x.

    {\displaystyle (z,({\mathcal {o}}_{x}/j)|_{z})}

if all local rings are cohen-macaulay.

the scheme is connected as a topological space. since the connected components refine the irreducible components any irreducible scheme is connected but not vice versa. an affine scheme spec(r) is connected iff the ring r possesses no idempotents other than 0 and 1; such a ring is also called a connected ring.

examples of connected schemes include affine space, projective space, and an example of a scheme that is not connected is

dimension
the dimension, by definition the maximal length of a chain of irreducible closed subschemes, is a global property. it can be seen locally if a scheme is irreducible. it depends only on the topology, not on the structure sheaf. see also global dimension.

examples: equidimensional schemes in dimension 0: artinian schemes, 1: algebraic curves, 2: algebraic surfaces.

degree
1.  the degree of a line bundle l on a complete variety is an integer d such that 
  
    
      
        χ

divisorial
1.  a divisorial sheaf on a normal variety is a reflexive sheaf of the form ox(d) for some weil divisor d.
2.  a divisorial scheme is a scheme admitting an ample family of invertible sheaves. a scheme admitting an ample invertible sheaf is a basic example.

dominant
a morphism f : x → y is called dominant, if the image f(x) is dense. a morphism of affine schemes spec a → spec b is dense if and only if the kernel of the corresponding map b → a is contained in the nilradical of b.

dualizing complex

dualizing sheaf
on a projective cohen–macaulay scheme of pure dimension n, the dualizing sheaf is a coherent sheaf 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   on x such that

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            n
            −
            i
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        
          f
          
            ∨
          
        
        ⊗
        ω
        )
        ≃

    {\displaystyle h^{n-i}(x,f^{\vee }\otimes \omega )\simeq h^{i}(x,f)^{*}}
  
holds for any locally free sheaf f on x; for example, if x is a smooth projective variety, then it is a canonical sheaf.

étale
a morphism f : y → x is étale if it is flat and unramified. there are several other equivalent definitions. in the case of smooth varieties 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   over an algebraically closed field, étale morphisms are precisely those inducing an isomorphism of tangent spaces 
  
    
      
        d
        f
        :
        
          t
          
            y
          
        
        y
        →
        
          t
          
            f
            (
            y
            )
          
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle df:t_{y}y\rightarrow t_{f(y)}x}
  , which coincides with the usual notion of étale map in differential geometry.

étale morphisms form a very important class of morphisms; they are used to build the so-called étale topology and consequently the étale cohomology, which is nowadays one of the cornerstones of algebraic geometry.
euler sequence
the exact sequence of sheaves:

fano
a fano variety is a smooth projective variety x whose anticanonical sheaf 
  
    
      
        
          ω

    {\displaystyle \omega _{x}^{-1}}
   is ample.

fiber
given 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:x\to y}
   between schemes, the fiber of f over y is, as a set, the pre-image 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −

          |
        
        f
        (
        x

        =
        y
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)=\{x\in x|f(x)=y\}}
  ; it has the natural structure of a scheme over the residue field of y as the fiber product

        {

    {\displaystyle \{y\}}
   has the natural structure of a scheme over y as spec of the residue field of y.

    {\displaystyle \psi '\circ f(\alpha )=g(\beta )\circ \psi }
  . the resulting square with obvious projections does not commute; rather, it commutes up to natural isomorphism; i.e., it 2-commutes.

final
one of grothendieck's fundamental ideas is to emphasize relative notions, i.e. conditions on morphisms rather than conditions on schemes themselves. the category of schemes has a final object, the spectrum of the ring 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} }
   of integers; so that any scheme 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is over 
  
    
      
        
          
            spec
          
        
        (
        
          z
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textrm {spec}}(\mathbb {z} )}
  , and in a unique way.

finite
the morphism f : y → x is finite if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   may be covered by affine open sets 
  
    
      
        
          spec 
        
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{spec }}b}
   such that each 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        
          spec 
        
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}({\text{spec }}b)}
   is affine — say of the form 
  
    
      
        
          spec 
        
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{spec }}a}
   — and furthermore 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is finitely generated as a 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  -module.  see finite morphism.

finite morphisms are quasi-finite, but not all morphisms having finite fibers are quasi-finite, and morphisms of finite type are usually not quasi-finite.

finite type (locally)
the morphism f : y → x is locally of finite type if 
  
    
      
        x

          spec 
        
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{spec }}a}
   where each

finite fibers

        x

    {\displaystyle x\in x}
   is a finite set. a morphism is quasi-finite if it is of finite type and has finite fibers.

finite presentation
if y is a point of y, then the morphism f is of finite presentation at y (or finitely presented at y) if there is an open affine neighborhood u of f(y) and an open affine neighbourhood v of y such that f(v) ⊆ u and

== i ==
image
if f : y → x is any morphism of schemes, the scheme-theoretic image of f is the unique closed subscheme i : z → x which satisfies the following universal property:
f factors through i,
if j : z′ → x is any closed subscheme of x such that f factors through j, then i also factors through j.
this notion is distinct from that of the usual set-theoretic image of f, f(y). for example, the underlying space of z always contains (but is not necessarily equal to) the zariski closure of f(y) in x, so if y is any open (and not closed) subscheme of x and f is the inclusion map, then z is different from f(y). when y is reduced, then z is the zariski closure of f(y) endowed with the structure of reduced closed subscheme. but in general, unless f is quasi-compact, the construction of z is not local on x.

immersion
immersions f : y → x are maps that factor through isomorphisms with subschemes. specifically, an open immersion factors through an isomorphism with an open subscheme and a closed immersion factors through an isomorphism with a closed subscheme. equivalently, f is a closed immersion if, and only if, it induces a homeomorphism from the underlying topological space of y to a closed subset of the underlying topological space of x, and if the morphism 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            ♯
          
        
        :
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            x
          
        
        →
        
          f
          
            ∗
          
        
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            y
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{\sharp }:{\mathcal {o}}_{x}\to f_{*}{\mathcal {o}}_{y}}
   is surjective. a composition of immersions is again an immersion.

some authors, such as hartshorne in his book algebraic geometry and q. liu in his book algebraic geometry and arithmetic curves, define immersions as the composite of an open immersion followed by a closed immersion. these immersions are immersions in the sense above, but the converse is false. furthermore, under this definition, the composite of two immersions is not necessarily an immersion. however, the two definitions are equivalent when f is quasi-compact.

note that an open immersion is completely described by its image in the sense of topological spaces, while a closed immersion is not: 
  
    
      
        spec
        ⁡
        a
        
          /
        
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {spec} a/i}
   and 
  
    
      
        spec

          /
        
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {spec} a/j}
   may be homeomorphic but not isomorphic. this happens, for example, if i is the radical of j but j is not a radical ideal. when specifying a closed subset of a scheme without mentioning the scheme structure, usually the so-called reduced scheme structure is meant, that is, the scheme structure corresponding to the unique radical ideal consisting of all functions vanishing on that closed subset.

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {g} _{m}}
   (i.e., line bundle).
integral
a scheme that is both reduced and irreducible is called integral. for locally noetherian schemes, to be integral is equivalent to being a connected scheme that is covered by the spectra of integral domains. (strictly speaking, this is not a local property, because the disjoint union of two integral schemes is not integral. however, for irreducible schemes, it is a local property.)

for example, the scheme spec k[t]/f, f irreducible polynomial is integral, while spec a×b. (a, b ≠ 0) is not.

irreducible 
a scheme x is said to be irreducible when (as a topological space) it is not the union of two closed subsets except if one is equal to x. using the correspondence of prime ideals and points in an affine scheme, this means x is irreducible iff x is connected and the rings ai all have exactly one minimal prime ideal. (rings possessing exactly one minimal prime ideal are therefore also called irreducible.) any noetherian scheme can be written uniquely as the union of finitely many maximal irreducible non-empty closed subsets, called its irreducible components. affine space and projective space are irreducible, while 
spec k[x,y]/(xy) =  is not.

local 
most important properties of schemes are local in nature, i.e. a scheme x has a certain property p if and only if for any cover of x by open subschemes xi, i.e. x=
  
    
      
        ∪
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cup }
   xi, every xi has the property p. it is usually the case that is enough to check one cover, not all possible ones. one also says that a certain property is zariski-local, if one needs to distinguish between the zariski topology and other possible topologies, like the étale topology.

consider a scheme x and a cover by affine open subschemes spec ai. using the dictionary between (commutative) rings and affine schemes local properties are thus properties of the rings ai. a property p is local in the above sense, iff the corresponding property of rings is stable under localization.

for example, we can speak of locally noetherian schemes, namely those which are covered by the spectra of noetherian rings. the fact that localizations of a noetherian ring are still noetherian then means that the property of a scheme of being locally noetherian is local in the above sense (whence the name). another example: if a ring is reduced (i.e., has no non-zero nilpotent elements), then so are its localizations.

an example for a non-local property is separatedness (see below for the definition). any affine scheme is separated, therefore any scheme is locally separated. however, the affine pieces may glue together pathologically to yield a non-separated scheme.

the following is a (non-exhaustive) list of local properties of rings, which are applied to schemes. let x =

locally noetherian
the ai are noetherian rings. if in addition a finite number of such affine spectra covers x, the scheme is called noetherian. while it is true that the spectrum of a noetherian ring is a noetherian topological space, the converse is false. 
for example, most schemes in finite-dimensional algebraic geometry are locally noetherian, but

nonsingular
an archaic term for "smooth" as in a smooth variety.

normal
1.  an integral scheme is called normal, if the local rings are integrally closed domains. 
for example, all regular schemes are normal, while singular curves are not.
2.  a smooth curve 
  
    
      
        c
        ⊂

    {\displaystyle c\subset \mathbf {p} ^{r}}
   is said to be k-normal if the hypersurfaces of degree k cut out the complete linear series

    {\displaystyle |{\mathcal {o}}_{c}(k)|}
  . it is projectively normal if it is k-normal for all k > 0. one thus says that "a curve is projectively normal if the linear system that embeds it is complete." the term "linearly normal" is synonymous with 1-normal.
3.  a closed subvariety 
  
    
      
        x
        ⊂

    {\displaystyle x\subset \mathbf {p} ^{r}}
   is said to be projectively normal if the affine cover over x is a normal scheme; i.e., the homogeneous coordinate ring of x is an integrally closed domain. this meaning is consistent with that of 2.

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {spec} _{x}(\oplus _{0}^{\infty }i^{n}/i^{n+1})}
  . if x is regularly embedded into y, then the normal cone is isomorphic to

== o ==
open
1.  a morphism f : y → x of schemes is called open (closed), if the underlying map of topological spaces is open (closed, respectively), i.e. if open subschemes of y are mapped to open subschemes of x (and similarly for closed). for example, finitely presented flat morphisms are open and proper maps are closed.
2.  an open subscheme of a scheme x is an open subset u with structure sheaf

    {\displaystyle k}

geometric points are what in the most classical cases, for example algebraic varieties that are complex manifolds, would be the ordinary-sense points. the points 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   of the underlying space include analogues of the generic points (in the sense of zariski, not that of andré weil), which specialise to ordinary-sense points. the 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  -valued points are thought of, via yoneda's lemma, as a way of identifying 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   with the representable functor 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{s}}
   it sets up. historically there was a process by which projective geometry added more points (e.g. complex points, line at infinity) to simplify the geometry by refining the basic objects. the 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  -valued points were a massive further step.

as part of the predominating grothendieck approach, there are three corresponding notions of fiber of a morphism: the first being the simple inverse image of a point. the other two are formed by creating fiber products of two morphisms. for example, a geometric fiber of a morphism 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            ′
          
        
        →
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{\prime }\to s}
   is thought of as

  
    
      
        
          s
          
            ′
          
        
        
          ×
          
            s
          
        
        
          
            spec
          
        
        (
        
          
            k
            ¯
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{\prime }\times _{s}{\textrm {spec}}({\overline {k}})}
  .

this makes the extension from affine schemes, where it is just the tensor product of r-algebras, to all schemes of the fiber product operation a significant (if technically anodyne) result.

(in short, 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            ∗

projective
1.  a projective variety is a closed subvariety of a projective space.
2.  a projective scheme over a scheme s is an s-scheme that factors through some projective space 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
          
            s
          
          
            n
          
        
        →
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{s}^{n}\to s}
   as a closed subscheme.
3.  projective morphisms are defined similarly to affine morphisms: f : y → x is called projective if it factors as a closed immersion followed by the projection of a projective space 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
          
            x
          
          
            n
          
        
        :=
        
          
            p
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          ×
          
            
              s
              p
              e
              c
            
            
              z
            
          
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {p} _{x}^{n}:=\mathbb {p} ^{n}\times _{\mathrm {spec} \mathbb {z} }x}
   to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . note that this definition is more restrictive than that of ega, ii.5.5.2. the latter defines 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   to be projective if it is given by the global proj of a quasi-coherent graded ox-algebra 
  
    
      
        
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {s}}}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              s
            
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {s}}_{1}}
   is finitely generated and generates the algebra 
  
    
      
        
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {s}}}
  . both definitions coincide when 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is affine or more generally if it is quasi-compact, separated and admits an ample sheaf, e.g. if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is an open subscheme of a projective space 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
          
            a
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {p} _{a}^{n}}
   over a ring 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  .

projective bundle
if e is a locally free sheaf on a scheme x, the projective bundle p(e) of e is the global proj of the symmetric algebra of the dual of e:

  
    
      
        
          p
        
        (
        e
        )
        =
        
          p
          r
          o
          j
        
        (
        
          sym
          
            
              
                
                  o
                
              
              
                x
              
            
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        
          e
          
            ∨
          
        
        )
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} (e)=\mathbf {proj} (\operatorname {sym} _{{\mathcal {o}}_{x}}(e^{\vee })).}
  
note this definition is standard nowadays (e.g., fulton's intersection theory) but differs from ega and hartshorne (they don't take a dual).

projectively normal
see #normal.

proper
a morphism is proper if it is separated, universally closed (i.e. such that fiber products with it are closed maps), and of finite type. projective morphisms are proper; but the converse is not in general true. see also complete variety. a deep property of proper morphisms is the existence of a stein factorization, namely the existence of an intermediate scheme such that a morphism can be expressed as one with connected fibres, followed by a finite morphism.

property p
let p be a property of a scheme that is stable under base change (finite-type, proper, smooth, étale, etc.). then a representable morphism 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        f
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:f\to g}
   is said to have property p if, for any 
  
    
      
        b
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\to g}
   with b a scheme, the base change 
  
    
      
        f
        
          ×
          
            g
          
        
        b
        →
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\times _{g}b\to b}
   has property p.

quasi-projective
a quasi-projective variety is a locally closed subvariety of a projective space.

quasi-separated 
a morphism f : y → x is called quasi-separated or (y is quasi-separated over x) if the diagonal morphism y → y ×xy is quasi-compact. a scheme y is called quasi-separated if y is quasi-separated over spec(z).

quot scheme
a quot scheme parametrizes quotients of locally free sheaves on a projective scheme.

quotient stack
usually denoted by [x/g], a quotient stack generalizes a quotient of a scheme or variety.

riemann–roch formula
1.  if l is a line bundle of degree d on a smooth projective curve of genus g, then the riemann–roch formula computes the euler characteristic of l:

        (
        l
        )
        =

  .
for example, the formula implies the degree of the canonical divisor k is 2g - 2.2.  the general version is due to grothendieck and called the grothendieck–riemann–roch formula. it says: if

universal
1.  if a moduli functor f is represented by some scheme or algebraic space m, then a universal object is an element of f(m) that corresponds to the identity morphism m → m (which is an m-point of m). if the values of f are isomorphism classes of curves with extra structure, say, then a universal object is called a universal curve. a tautological bundle would be another example of a universal object.
