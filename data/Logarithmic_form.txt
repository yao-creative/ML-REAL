in contexts including complex manifolds and algebraic geometry, a logarithmic differential form is a meromorphic differential form with poles of a certain kind. the concept was introduced by deligne.let x be a complex manifold, d ⊂ x a divisor, and ω a holomorphic p-form on x−d. if ω and dω have a pole of order at most one along d, then ω is said to have a logarithmic pole along d. ω is also known as a logarithmic p-form. the logarithmic p-forms make up a subsheaf of the meromorphic p-forms on x with a pole along d, denoted

    {\displaystyle f(z)=z^{m}g(z)}
  , where g is holomorphic and non-vanishing at 0,  and m is the order of f at 0. that is, for some open covering, there are local representations of this differential form as a logarithmic derivative (modified slightly with the exterior derivative d in place of the usual differential operator d/dz). observe that ω has only simple poles with integer residues. on higher-dimensional complex manifolds, the poincaré residue is used to describe the distinctive behavior of logarithmic forms along poles.

  vital to the residue theory of logarithmic forms is the gysin sequence, which is in some sense a generalization of the residue theorem for compact riemann surfaces. this can be used to show, for example, that 
  
    
      
        d

          /

    {\displaystyle dx/y|_{d}}
   extends to a holomorphic one-form on the projective closure of d in p2, a smooth elliptic curve.


=== hodge theory ===
the holomorphic log complex can be brought to bear on the hodge theory of complex algebraic varieties. let x be a complex algebraic manifold and 
  
    
      
        j
        :
        x
        ↪

    {\displaystyle j:x\hookrightarrow y}
   a good compactification. this means that y is a compact algebraic manifold and d = y−x is a divisor on y with simple normal crossings. the natural inclusion of complexes of sheaves

classically, for example in elliptic function theory, the logarithmic differential forms were recognised as complementary to the differentials of the first kind. they were sometimes called differentials of the second kind (and, with an unfortunate inconsistency, also sometimes of the third kind). the classical theory has now been subsumed as an aspect of hodge theory. for a riemann surface s, for example, the differentials of the first kind account for the term h1,0 in h1(s), when by the dolbeault isomorphism it is interpreted as the sheaf cohomology group h0(s,ω); this is tautologous considering their definition. the h1,0 direct summand in h1(s), as well as being interpreted as h1(s,o) where o is the sheaf of holomorphic functions on s, can be identified more concretely with a vector space of logarithmic differentials.
