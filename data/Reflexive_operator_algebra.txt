in functional analysis, a reflexive operator algebra a is an operator algebra that has enough invariant subspaces to characterize it. formally, a is reflexive if it is equal to the algebra of bounded operators which leave invariant each subspace left invariant by every operator in a.
this should not be confused with a reflexive space.


== examples ==
nest algebras are examples of reflexive operator algebras. in finite dimensions, these are simply algebras of all matrices of a given size whose nonzero entries lie in an upper-triangular pattern.
in fact if we fix any pattern of entries in an n by n matrix containing the diagonal, then the set of all n by n matrices whose nonzero entries lie in this pattern forms a reflexive algebra.
an example of an algebra which is not reflexive is the set of 2 × 2 matrices

if t is a fixed n by n matrix then the set of all polynomials in t and the identity operator forms a unital operator algebra. a theorem of deddens and fillmore states that this algebra is reflexive if and only if the largest two blocks in the jordan normal form of t differ in size by at most one. for example, the algebra

  . a hyper-reflexive operator algebra is automatically reflexive.
in the case of a reflexive algebra of matrices with nonzero entries specified by a given pattern, the problem of finding the distance constant can be rephrased as a matrix-filling problem: if we fill the entries in the complement of the pattern with arbitrary entries, what choice of entries in the pattern gives the smallest operator norm?


== examples ==
every finite-dimensional reflexive algebra is hyper-reflexive. however, there are examples of infinite-dimensional reflexive operator algebras which are not hyper-reflexive.
the distance constant for a one-dimensional algebra is 1.
nest algebras are hyper-reflexive with distance constant 1.
many von neumann algebras are hyper-reflexive, but it is not known if they all are.
a type i von neumann algebra is hyper-reflexive with distance constant at most 2.
