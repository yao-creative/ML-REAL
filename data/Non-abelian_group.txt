in mathematics, and specifically in group theory, a non-abelian group, sometimes called a non-commutative group, is a group (g, ∗) in which there exists at least one pair of elements a and b of g, such that a ∗ b ≠ b ∗ a. this class of groups contrasts with the abelian groups. (in an abelian group, all pairs of group elements commute). 
non-abelian groups are pervasive in mathematics and physics. one of the simplest examples of a non-abelian group is the dihedral group of order 6. it is the smallest finite non-abelian group. a common example from physics is the rotation group so(3) in three dimensions (for example, rotating something 90 degrees along one axis and then 90 degrees along a different axis is not the same as doing them in reverse order).
both discrete groups and continuous groups may be non-abelian. most of the interesting lie groups are non-abelian, and these play an important role in gauge theory.
