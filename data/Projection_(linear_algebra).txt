in linear algebra and functional analysis, a projection is a linear transformation 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   from a vector space to itself (an endomorphism) such that 
  
    
      
        p
        ∘
        p
        =
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\circ p=p}
  . that is, whenever 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is applied twice to any vector, it gives the same result as if it were applied once (i.e. 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is idempotent). it leaves its image unchanged. this definition of "projection" formalizes and generalizes the idea of graphical projection.  one can also consider the effect of a projection on a geometrical object by examining the effect of the projection on points in the object.

a projection on a vector space 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is a linear operator 
  
    
      
        p
        :
        v
        →
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle p:v\to v}

when 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   has an inner product and is complete (i.e. when 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is a hilbert space) the concept of orthogonality can be used. a projection 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   on a hilbert space 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is called an orthogonal projection if it satisfies 
  
    
      
        ⟨

        ∈
        v

by definition, a projection 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is idempotent (i.e. 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        =
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{2}=p}
  ).


=== complementarity of image and kernel ===
let 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}
   be a finite-dimensional vector space and 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   be a projection on 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}

        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   has the following properties:

  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is the identity operator

  the image and kernel of a projection are complementary, as are 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   and

        i
        −
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle q=i-p}
  . the operator 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
   is also a projection as the image and kernel of 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   become the kernel and image of 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
   and vice versa. we say 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is a projection along 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   onto 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   (kernel/image) and 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
   is a projection along 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   onto 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
  .


=== spectrum ===
in infinite-dimensional vector spaces, the spectrum of a projection is contained in 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0,1\}}
   as

  
    
      
        (
        λ
        i
        −
        p
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            λ
          
        
        i
        +
        
          
            1
            
              λ
              (
              λ
              −
              1
              )
            
          
        
        p
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\lambda i-p)^{-1}={\frac {1}{\lambda }}i+{\frac {1}{\lambda (\lambda -1)}}p.}
  only 0 or 1 can be an eigenvalue of a projection. this implies that an orthogonal projection 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is always a positive semi-definite matrix. in general, the corresponding eigenspaces are (respectively) the kernel and range of the projection. decomposition of a vector space into direct sums is not unique. therefore, given a subspace 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
  , there may be many projections whose range (or kernel) is 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
  .
if a projection is nontrivial it has minimal polynomial 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        −
        x
        =
        x
        (
        x
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{2}-x=x(x-1)}
  , which factors into distinct linear factors, and thus 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is diagonalizable.


=== product of projections ===
the product of projections is not in general a projection, even if they are orthogonal. if two projections commute then their product is a projection, but the converse is false: the product of two non-commuting projections may be a projection. 
if two orthogonal projections commute then their product is an orthogonal projection. if the product of two orthogonal projections is an orthogonal projection, then the two orthogonal projections commute (more generally: two self-adjoint endomorphisms commute if and only if their product is self-adjoint).


=== orthogonal projections ===

when the vector space 
  
    
      
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle w}
   has an inner product and is complete (is a hilbert space) the concept of orthogonality can be used. an orthogonal projection is a projection for which the range 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   and the null space 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   are orthogonal subspaces. thus, for every 
  
    
      
        
          x

==== properties and special cases ====
an orthogonal projection is a bounded operator. this is because for every 
  
    
      
        
          v
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
   in the vector space we have, by the cauchy–schwarz inequality:

  
    
      
        
          
            ‖
            
              p
              
                v
              
            
            ‖
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        ⟨
        p
        
          v
        
        ,
        p
        
          v
        
        ⟩
        =
        ⟨
        p
        
          v
        
        ,
        
          v

        ≤

  thus

    {\displaystyle \left\|p\mathbf {v} \right\|\leq \left\|\mathbf {v} \right\|}
  .
for finite-dimensional complex or real vector spaces, the standard inner product can be substituted for 
  
    
      
        ⟨

        ⋅

===== formulas =====
a simple case occurs when the orthogonal projection is onto a line. if 
  
    
      
        
          u
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
   is a unit vector on the line, then the projection is given by the outer product

  
    
      
        
          p
          
            
              u
            
          
        
        =
        
          u
        
        
          
            u
          
          
            
              t
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\mathbf {u} }=\mathbf {u} \mathbf {u} ^{\mathrm {t} }.}
  (if 
  
    
      
        
          u
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
   is complex-valued, the transpose in the above equation is replaced by a hermitian transpose). this operator leaves u invariant, and it annihilates all vectors orthogonal to 
  
    
      
        
          u
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
  , proving that it is indeed the orthogonal projection onto the line containing u. a simple way to see this is to consider an arbitrary vector 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
   as the sum of a component on the line (i.e. the projected vector we seek) and another perpendicular to it, 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
        =
        
          
            x
          
          
            ∥
          
        
        +

            ⊥
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =\mathbf {x} _{\parallel }+\mathbf {x} _{\perp }}
  . applying projection, we get

  
    
      
        
          p

  all these formulas also hold for complex inner product spaces, provided that the conjugate transpose is used instead of the transpose. further details on sums of projectors can be found in banerjee and roy (2014). also see banerjee (2004) for application of sums of projectors in basic spherical trigonometry.


=== oblique projections ===
the term oblique projections is sometimes used to refer to non-orthogonal projections. these projections are also used to represent spatial figures in two-dimensional drawings (see oblique projection), though not as frequently as orthogonal projections. whereas calculating the fitted value of an ordinary least squares regression requires an orthogonal projection, calculating the fitted value of an instrumental variables regression requires an oblique projection.
projections are defined by their null space and the basis vectors used to characterize their range (which is the complement of the null space). when these basis vectors are orthogonal to the null space, then the projection is an orthogonal projection. when these basis vectors are not orthogonal to the null space, the projection is an oblique projection. let the vectors 
  
    
      
        
          
            u

            u
          
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {u} _{k}}
   form a basis for the range of the projection, and assemble these vectors in the 
  
    
      
        n
        ×
        k

   matrix 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  . the range and the null space are complementary spaces, so the null space has dimension 
  
    
      
        n
        −
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle n-k}
  . it follows that the orthogonal complement of the null space has dimension 
  
    
      
        k

  . let

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {v} _{k}}
   form a basis for the orthogonal complement of the null space of the projection, and assemble these vectors in the matrix 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  . then the projection is defined by

  
    
      
        p
        =
        a

              a
            
            )

== projections on normed vector spaces ==
when the underlying vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a (not necessarily finite-dimensional) normed vector space, analytic questions, irrelevant in the finite-dimensional case, need to be considered. assume now 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a banach space.
many of the algebraic results discussed above survive the passage to this context. a given direct sum decomposition of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   into complementary subspaces still specifies a projection, and vice versa. if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is the direct sum 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        u
        ⊕
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=u\oplus v}
  , then the operator defined by 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        u
        +
        v
        )
        =
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(u+v)=u}
   is still a projection with range 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   and kernel 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
  . it is also clear that 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        =
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{2}=p}
  . conversely, if 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is projection on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , i.e. 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        =
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{2}=p}
  , then it is easily verified that 
  
    
      
        (
        1
        −
        p
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
        =
        (
        1
        −
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (1-p)^{2}=(1-p)}
  . in other words, 
  
    
      
        1
        −
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1-p}
   is also a projection. the relation 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        =
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{2}=p}
   implies 
  
    
      
        1
        =
        p
        +
        (
        1
        −
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1=p+(1-p)}
   and 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is the direct sum 
  
    
      
        rg
        ⁡
        (
        p
        )
        ⊕
        rg
        ⁡
        (
        1
        −
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {rg} (p)\oplus \operatorname {rg} (1-p)}
  .
however, in contrast to the finite-dimensional case, projections need not be continuous in general. if a subspace 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is not closed in the norm topology, then the projection onto 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is not continuous. in other words, the range of a continuous projection 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   must be a closed subspace. furthermore, the kernel of a continuous projection (in fact, a continuous linear operator in general) is closed. thus a continuous projection 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   gives a decomposition of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   into two complementary closed subspaces: 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        rg
        ⁡
        (
        p
        )
        ⊕
        ker
        ⁡
        (
        p
        )
        =
        ker
        ⁡
        (
        1
        −
        p
        )
        ⊕
        ker
        ⁡
        (
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\operatorname {rg} (p)\oplus \ker(p)=\ker(1-p)\oplus \ker(p)}
  .
the converse holds also, with an additional assumption. suppose 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is a closed subspace of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . if there exists a closed subspace 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   such that x = u ⊕ v, then the projection 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   with range 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   and kernel 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is continuous. this follows from the closed graph theorem. suppose xn → x and pxn → y. one needs to show that 
  
    
      
        p
        x
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle px=y}
  . since 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is closed and {pxn} ⊂ u, y lies in 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  , i.e. py = y. also, xn − pxn = (i − p)xn → x − y. because 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is closed and {(i − p)xn} ⊂ v, we have 
  
    
      
        x
        −
        y
        ∈
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle x-y\in v}
  , i.e. 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        x
        −
        y
        )
        =
        p
        x
        −
        p
        y
        =
        p
        x
        −
        y
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(x-y)=px-py=px-y=0}
  , which proves the claim.
the above argument makes use of the assumption that both 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   and 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   are closed. in general, given a closed subspace 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  , there need not exist a complementary closed subspace 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
  , although for hilbert spaces this can always be done by taking the orthogonal complement. for banach spaces, a one-dimensional subspace always has a closed complementary subspace. this is an immediate consequence of hahn–banach theorem. let 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   be the linear span of 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  . by hahn–banach, there exists a bounded linear functional 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   such that φ(u) = 1. the operator 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        x
        )
        =
        φ
        (
        x
        )
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(x)=\varphi (x)u}
   satisfies 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        =
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{2}=p}
  , i.e. it is a projection. boundedness of 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   implies continuity of 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   and therefore 
  
    
      
        ker
        ⁡
        (
        p
        )
        =
        rg
        ⁡
        (
        i
        −
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ker(p)=\operatorname {rg} (i-p)}
   is a closed complementary subspace of 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  .


== applications and further considerations ==
projections (orthogonal and otherwise) play a major role in algorithms for certain linear algebra problems:

qr decomposition (see householder transformation and gram–schmidt decomposition);
singular value decomposition
reduction to hessenberg form (the first step in many eigenvalue algorithms)
linear regression
projective elements of matrix algebras are used in the construction of certain k-groups in operator k-theoryas stated above, projections are a special case of idempotents. analytically, orthogonal projections are non-commutative generalizations of characteristic functions. idempotents are used in classifying, for instance, semisimple algebras, while measure theory begins with considering characteristic functions of measurable sets. therefore, as one can imagine, projections are very often encountered in the context of operator algebras. in particular, a von neumann algebra is generated by its complete lattice of projections.


== generalizations ==
more generally, given a map between normed vector spaces 
  
    
      
        t
        :
        v
        →
        w
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle t\colon v\to w,}
   one can analogously ask for this map to be an isometry on the orthogonal complement of the kernel: that 
  
    
      
        (
        ker
        ⁡
        t
        
          )
          
            ⊥
          
        
        →
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\ker t)^{\perp }\to w}
   be an isometry (compare partial isometry); in particular it must be onto. the case of an orthogonal projection is when w is a subspace of v. in riemannian geometry, this is used in the definition of a riemannian submersion.
