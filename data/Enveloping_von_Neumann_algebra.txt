in operator algebras, the enveloping von neumann algebra of a c*-algebra is a von neumann algebra that contains all the operator-algebraic information about the given c*-algebra. this may also be called the universal enveloping von neumann algebra, since it is given by a universal property; and (as always with von neumann algebras) the term w*-algebra may be used in place of von neumann algebra.


== definition ==
let a be a c*-algebra and πu be its universal representation, acting on hilbert space hu. the image of πu, πu(a), is a c*-subalgebra of bounded operators on hu. the enveloping von neumann algebra of a is the closure of πu(a) in the weak operator topology. it is sometimes denoted by a′′.


== properties ==
the universal representation πu and a′′ satisfies the following universal property: for any representation π, there is a unique *-homomorphism

  
    
      
        φ
        :
        
          π
          
            u
          
        
        (
        a
        
          )
          ″
        
        →
        π
        (
        a
        
          )
          ″
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :\pi _{u}(a)''\rightarrow \pi (a)''}
  that is continuous in the weak operator topology and the restriction of φ to πu(a) is π.
as a particular case, one can consider the continuous functional calculus, whose unique extension gives a canonical borel functional calculus.
by the sherman–takeda theorem, the double dual of a c*-algebra a, a**, can be identified with a′′, as banach spaces.
every representation of a uniquely determines a central projection (i.e. a projection in the center of the algebra) in a′′; it is called the central cover of that projection.
