distributions, also known as schwartz distributions or generalized functions, are objects that generalize the classical notion of functions in mathematical analysis. distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense. in particular, any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative.
distributions are widely used in the theory of partial differential equations, where it may be easier to establish the existence of distributional solutions than classical solutions, or where appropriate classical solutions may not exist. distributions are also important in physics and engineering where many problems naturally lead to differential equations whose solutions or initial conditions are singular, such as the dirac delta function.
a function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is normally thought of as acting on the points in its domain by sending a point x in its domain to the point 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x).}
   instead, distribution theory reinterprets functions as being equivalent to their dual linear functionals: if every nicely behaved test function integrated with a function gives out the same result, this defines a linear functional equivalent to every conventional function.
however, this kind of definition is much laxer, and admits mathematical objects beyond functions. in particular, these kinds of generalised functions can be used to represent singular measures, such as the delta function, and all of its derivatives. since the distributional framework is localised, linear, and shift-invariant, it can represent almost all of the compositions of the basis waveforms as well. it also admits a full fourier theory, and since the theory is fully localised, there is no need to have functions fall off in time or shift.
in applications to physics and engineering, test functions are usually infinitely differentiable complex-valued (or real-valued) functions with compact support that are defined on some given non-empty open subset 
  
    
      
        u
        ⊆
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\subseteq \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   (bump functions are examples of test functions). the set of all such test functions forms a vector space that is denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            c

        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{c}^{\infty }(u)}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
        
        (
        u
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}(u).}
  
most commonly encountered functions, including all continuous maps

        →

   can be canonically reinterpreted as acting via "integration against a test function." explicitly, this means that

   "acts on" a test function

          r
        
        :

   it is linear and also continuous when

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}(\mathbb {r} )}
   is given a certain topology called the canonical lf topology. 
distributions like 
  
    
      
        
          d
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle d_{f}}
   that arise from functions in this way are prototypical examples of distributions, but there are many which cannot be defined by integration against any function. examples of the latter include the dirac delta function and distributions defined to act by integration of test functions against certain measures. it is nonetheless still possible to reduce any arbitrary distribution down to a simpler family of related distributions that do arise via such actions of integration.
more generally, a distribution on 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is by definition a linear functional on 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            c
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{c}^{\infty }(u)}
   that is continuous when 
  
    
      
        
          c

        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{c}^{\infty }(u)}
   is given a topology called the canonical lf topology. this leads to the space of (all) distributions on 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  , usually denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          ′
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}'(u)}
   (note the prime), which by definition is the space of all distributions on 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   (that is, it is the continuous dual space of 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            c

        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{c}^{\infty }(u)}
  ); it is these distributions that are the main focus of this article.
definitions of the appropriate topologies on spaces of test functions and distributions are given in the article on spaces of test functions and distributions.
this article is primarily concerned with the definition of distributions, together with their properties and some important examples.


== history ==
the practical use of distributions can be traced back to the use of green functions in the 1830s to solve ordinary differential equations, but was not formalized until much later. according to kolmogorov & fomin (1957), generalized functions originated in the work of sergei sobolev (1936) on second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations, and the ideas were developed in somewhat extended form by laurent schwartz in the late 1940s. according to his autobiography, schwartz introduced the term "distribution" by analogy with a distribution of electrical charge, possibly including not only point charges but also dipoles and so on. gårding (1997) comments that although the ideas in the transformative book by schwartz (1951) were not entirely new, it was schwartz's broad attack and conviction that distributions would be useful almost everywhere in analysis that made the difference.

== definitions of test functions and distributions ==
in this section, some basic notions and definitions needed to define real-valued distributions on u are introduced. further discussion of the topologies on the spaces of test functions and distributions are given in the article on spaces of test functions and distributions.

=== topology on ck(u) ===
we now introduce the seminorms that will define the topology on 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            k
          
        
        (
        u
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c^{k}(u).}
   different authors sometimes use different families of seminorms so we list the most common families below. however, the resulting topology is the same no matter which family is used.

each of the functions above are non-negative 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  -valued seminorms on 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            k
          
        
        (
        u
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c^{k}(u).}
  
each of the following families of seminorms generates the same locally convex vector topology on 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            k

        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c^{k}(u)}
  :

with this topology,

        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c^{k}(u)}
   becomes a locally convex (non-normable) fréchet space and all of the seminorms defined above are continuous on this space. all of the seminorms defined above are continuous functions on

thus the topology on

the canonical lf-topology is not metrizable and importantly, it is strictly finer than the subspace topology that

   at a particular point of u. however, as is the case with functions, distributions on u restrict to give distributions on open subsets of u. furthermore, distributions are locally determined in the sense that a distribution on all of u can be assembled from a distribution on an open cover of u satisfying some compatibility conditions on the overlaps. such a structure is known as a sheaf.

=== support of a distribution ===
this last corollary implies that for every distribution t on u, there exists a unique largest subset v of u such that t vanishes in v (and does not vanish in any open subset of u that is not contained in v); the complement in u of this unique largest open subset is called the support of t. thus

==== distributions of finite order with support in an open subset ====


=== global structure of distributions ===
the formal definition of distributions exhibits them as a subspace of a very large space, namely the topological dual of 
  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}(u)}
   (or the schwartz space 
  
    
      
        
          
            s
          
        
        (
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {s}}(\mathbb {r} ^{n})}
   for tempered distributions). it is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution might be. to answer this question, it is instructive to see distributions built up from a smaller space, namely the space of continuous functions. roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. a precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. this says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only as complicated as necessary.


==== distributions as sheafs ====


==== decomposition of distributions as sums of derivatives of continuous functions ====
by combining the above results, one may express any distribution on u as the sum of a series of distributions with compact support, where each of these distributions can in turn be written as a finite sum of distributional derivatives of continuous functions on u. in other words, for arbitrary

        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle t\in {\mathcal {d}}'(u)}
   we can write:

where 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            1

        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{1},p_{2},\ldots }
   are finite sets of multi-indices and the functions

note that the infinite sum above is well-defined as a distribution. the value of t for a given 
  
    
      
        f

=== preliminaries: transpose of a linear operator ===

operations on distributions and spaces of distributions are often defined by means of the transpose of a linear operator. this is because the transpose allows for a unified presentation of the many definitions in the theory of distributions and also because its properties are well known in functional analysis. for instance, the well-known hermitian adjoint of a linear operator between hilbert spaces is just the operator's transpose (but with the riesz representation theorem used to identify each hilbert space with its continuous dual space). in general the transpose of a continuous linear map

   is also continuous when both duals are endowed with their respective strong dual topologies; it is also continuous when both duals are endowed with their respective weak* topologies (see the articles polar topology and dual system for more details).
in the context of distributions, the characterization of the transpose can be refined slightly. let 
  
    
      
        a
        :
        
          
            d

        )

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a:{\mathcal {d}}(u)\to {\mathcal {d}}(u)}
   be a continuous linear map. then by definition, the transpose of a is the unique linear operator 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            t

   that satisfies:

however, since the image of

        u
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}'(u),}
   it is sufficient that the above equality hold for all distributions of the form 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        
          d
          
            ψ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=d_{\psi }}
   where 
  
    
      
        ψ
        ∈
        
          
            d

        u
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi \in {\mathcal {d}}(u).}
   explicitly, this means that the above condition holds if and only if the condition below holds:

    {\displaystyle p_{*}}
   to avoid confusion with the transpose map, that is defined by

the lemma combined with the fact that the formal transpose of the formal transpose is the original differential operator, that is, 
  
    
      
        
          p

   enables us to arrive at the correct definition: the formal transpose induces the (continuous) canonical linear operator

==== multiplication of distributions by smooth functions ====
a differential operator of order 0 is just multiplication by a smooth function. and conversely, if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a smooth function then 
  
    
      
        p
        :=
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p:=f(x)}
   is a differential operator of order 0, whose formal transpose is itself (that is, 
  
    
      
        
          p

  ). the induced differential operator

   maps a distribution t to a distribution denoted by 
  
    
      
        f
        t

   we have thus defined the multiplication of a distribution by a smooth function.
we now give an alternative presentation of multiplication by a smooth function. if

        m

    {\displaystyle mt}
   is defined by

this definition coincides with the transpose definition since if 
  
    
      
        m
        :
        
          
            d

        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle m:{\mathcal {d}}(u)\to {\mathcal {d}}(u)}
   is the operator of multiplication by the function m (that is, 
  
    
      
        (
        m
        ϕ

under multiplication by smooth functions, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d

   with this definition of multiplication by a smooth function, the ordinary product rule of calculus remains valid. however, a number of unusual identities also arise. for example, if

    {\displaystyle \delta }
   is the dirac delta distribution on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
        ,

   then

===== problem of multiplying distributions =====
it is easy to define the product of a distribution with a smooth function, or more generally the product of two distributions whose singular supports are disjoint. with more effort it is possible to define a well-behaved product of several distributions provided their wave front sets at each point are compatible. a limitation of the theory of distributions (and hyperfunctions) is that there is no associative product of two distributions extending the product of a distribution by a smooth function, as has been proved by laurent schwartz in the 1950s. for example, if 
  
    
      
        
          p
          .
          v
          .
        
        ⁡
        
          
            1
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {p.v.} {\frac {1}{x}}}
   is the distribution obtained by the cauchy principal value

if 
  
    
      
        δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta }
   is the dirac delta distribution then

but,

so the product of a distribution by a smooth function (which is always well defined) cannot be extended to an associative product on the space of distributions.
thus, nonlinear problems cannot be posed in general and thus not solved within distribution theory alone. in the context of quantum field theory, however, solutions can be found. in more than two spacetime dimensions the problem is related to the regularization of divergences. here henri epstein and vladimir glaser developed the mathematically rigorous (but extremely technical) causal perturbation theory. this does not solve the problem in other situations. many other interesting theories are non linear, like for example the navier–stokes equations of fluid dynamics.
several not entirely satisfactory theories of algebras of generalized functions have been developed, among which colombeau's (simplified) algebra is maybe the most popular in use today.
inspired by lyons' rough path theory, martin hairer proposed a consistent way of multiplying distributions with certain structure (regularity structures), available in many examples from stochastic analysis, notably stochastic partial differential equations. see also gubinelli–imkeller–perkowski (2015) for a related development based on bony's paraproduct from fourier analysis.


=== composition with a smooth function ===
let t be a distribution on 
  
    
      
        u
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle u.}
   let v be an open set in 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n},}
   and 
  
    
      
        f

        v
        →
        u
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:v\to u.}
   if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a submersion, it is possible to define

this is the composition of the distribution 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   with 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  , and is also called the pullback of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   along 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  , sometimes written

the pullback is often denoted 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            ∗
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{*},}
   although this notation should not be confused with the use of '*' to denote the adjoint of a linear mapping.
the condition that 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   be a submersion is equivalent to the requirement that the jacobian derivative 
  
    
      
        d
        f
        (
        x
        )

   of

   is a surjective linear map for every

        ∈
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in v.}
   a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for extending 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            #
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{\#}}
   to distributions is that 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   be an open mapping. the inverse function theorem ensures that a submersion satisfies this condition.
if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a submersion, then 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            #
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{\#}}
   is defined on distributions by finding the transpose map. uniqueness of this extension is guaranteed since 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            #
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{\#}}
   is a continuous linear operator on 
  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
        
        (
        u
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}(u).}
   existence, however, requires using the change of variables formula, the inverse function theorem (locally) and a partition of unity argument.in the special case when 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a diffeomorphism from an open subset v of 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   onto an open subset u of 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   change of variables under the integral gives:

in this particular case, then, 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            #
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{\#}}
   is defined by the transpose formula:


=== convolution ===
under some circumstances, it is possible to define the convolution of a function with a distribution, or even the convolution of two distributions.
recall that if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are functions on 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   then we denote by 
  
    
      
        f
        ∗
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\ast g}

        ,

==== convolution of distributions ====
it is also possible to define the convolution of two distributions

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n},}
   provided one of them has compact support. informally, in order to define 
  
    
      
        s
        ∗
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\ast t}
   where 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   has compact support, the idea is to extend the definition of the convolution 
  
    
      
        
        ∗

continues to hold for all test functions 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi .}
  it is also possible to provide a more explicit characterization of the convolution of distributions. suppose that 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   and

   are distributions and that 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   has compact support. then the linear maps

are continuous. the transposes of these maps:

are consequently continuous and it can also be shown that
this common value is called the convolution of 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   and 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   and it is a distribution that is denoted by 
  
    
      
        s
        ∗
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\ast t}
   or 
  
    
      
        t
        ∗
        s
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle t\ast s.}
   it satisfies 
  
    
      
        supp

==== convolution versus multiplication ====
in general, regularity is required for multiplication products and locality is required for convolution products. it is expressed in the following extension of the convolution theorem which guarantees the existence of both convolution and multiplication products. let 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        α
        )
        =
        f
        ∈

    {\displaystyle f(\alpha )=f\in {\mathcal {o}}'_{c}}
   be a rapidly decreasing tempered distribution or, equivalently, 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        f
        )
        =

        ∈
        
          
            
              o

    {\displaystyle f(f)=\alpha \in {\mathcal {o}}_{m}}
   be an ordinary (slowly growing, smooth) function within the space of tempered distributions and let 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   be the normalized (unitary, ordinary frequency) fourier transform then, according to schwartz (1951),

hold within the space of tempered distributions. in particular, these equations become the poisson summation formula if 
  
    
      
        g
        ≡
        
          ш
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\equiv \operatorname {\text{ш}} }
   is the dirac comb. the space of all rapidly decreasing tempered distributions is also called the space of convolution operators 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o
            
          
          
            c
          
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}'_{c}}
   and the space of all ordinary functions within the space of tempered distributions is also called the space of multiplication operators 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              o

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{m}.}
   more generally, 
  
    
      
        f
        (

   and

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f({\mathcal {o}}_{m})={\mathcal {o}}'_{c}.}
    a particular case is the paley-wiener-schwartz theorem which states that 
  
    
      
        f
        (

        )
        =
        pw
      
    
    {\displaystyle f({\mathcal {e}}')=\operatorname {pw} }
   and 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        pw
        )
        =

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\operatorname {pw} )={\mathcal {e}}'.}
   this is because 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              e

    {\textstyle \phi \mapsto \int _{u}f(x)\phi (x)\,dx}

the following is the theorem of the structure of distributions of radon measures, which shows that every radon measure can be written as a sum of derivatives of locally

   functions on u:


==== positive radon measures ====
a linear function 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   on a space of functions is called positive if whenever a function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   that belongs to the domain of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is non-negative (that is, 
  
    
      
        f

==== locally integrable functions as distributions ====
one particularly important class of radon measures are those that are induced locally integrable functions. the function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        u
        →
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:u\to \mathbb {r} }
   is called locally integrable if it is lebesgue integrable over every compact subset k of u. this is a large class of functions which includes all continuous functions and all lp space 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{p}}
   functions. the topology on 
  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}(u)}
   is defined in such a fashion that any locally integrable function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   yields a continuous linear functional on 
  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}(u)}
   – that is, an element of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d

        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}'(u)}
   – denoted here by 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            f
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{f},}
   whose value on the test function 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   is given by the lebesgue integral:

conventionally, one abuses notation by identifying 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{f}}
   with 
  
    
      
        f
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f,}
   provided no confusion can arise, and thus the pairing between 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{f}}
   and 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   is often written

if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are two locally integrable functions, then the associated distributions 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{f}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{g}}
   are equal to the same element of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          ′
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}'(u)}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are equal almost everywhere (see, for instance, hörmander (1983, theorem 1.2.5)). in a similar manner, every radon measure 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   on 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   defines an element of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          ′
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}'(u)}
   whose value on the test function 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   is 
  
    
      
        ∫
        ϕ
        
        d
        μ
        .
      
    
    {\textstyle \int \phi \,d\mu .}
   as above, it is conventional to abuse notation and write the pairing between a radon measure 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   and a test function 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   as 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        μ
        ,
        ϕ
        ⟩
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \mu ,\phi \rangle .}
   conversely, as shown in a theorem by schwartz (similar to the riesz representation theorem), every distribution which is non-negative on non-negative functions is of this form for some (positive) radon measure.


==== test functions as distributions ====

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}'(u).}
   this means that for any

there is a compact subset k of u such that for every test function

    {\displaystyle \phi }

  compactly supported distributions define continuous linear functionals on the space

  ; recall that the topology on

          ϕ
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi _{k}}
   converges to 0 if and only if all derivatives of 
  
    
      
        
          ϕ
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi _{k}}
   converge uniformly to 0 on every compact subset of u. conversely, it can be shown that every continuous linear functional on this space defines a distribution of compact support. thus compactly supported distributions can be identified with those distributions that can be extended from

the following is the theorem of the structure of distributions of finite order, which shows that every distribution of finite order can be written as a sum of derivatives of radon measures:

example. (distributions of infinite order) let 
  
    
      
        u
        :=
        (
        0
        ,
        ∞
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u:=(0,\infty )}
   and for every test function 
  
    
      
        f
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f,}
   let 
then 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is a distribution of infinite order on u. moreover, 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   can not be extended to a distribution on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  ; that is, there exists no distribution 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   on

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   such that the restriction of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   to u is equal to

=== tempered distributions and fourier transform ===

defined below are the tempered distributions, which form a subspace of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          ′
        
        (
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}'(\mathbb {r} ^{n}),}
   the space of distributions on 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}.}
   this is a proper subspace: while every tempered distribution is a distribution and an element of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
            
          
          ′
        
        (
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {d}}'(\mathbb {r} ^{n}),}
   the converse is not true. tempered distributions are useful if one studies the fourier transform since all tempered distributions have a fourier transform, which is not true for an arbitrary distribution in

the schwartz space is a fréchet space (that is, a complete metrizable locally convex space). because the fourier transform changes

          l
          
            p
          
        
        (
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{p}(\mathbb {r} ^{n})}
   for 
  
    
      
        p
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\geq 1}
   are tempered distributions.
the tempered distributions can also be characterized as slowly growing, meaning that each derivative of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   grows at most as fast as some polynomial. this characterization is dual to the rapidly falling behaviour of the derivatives of a function in the schwartz space, where each derivative of 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   decays faster than every inverse power of

        x
        
          |
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle |x|.}
   an example of a rapidly falling function is 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        x

==== fourier transform ====
to study the fourier transform, it is best to consider complex-valued test functions and complex-linear distributions. the ordinary continuous fourier transform 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          
            s
          
        
        (
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
        →
        
          
            s
          
        
        (
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:{\mathcal {s}}(\mathbb {r} ^{n})\to {\mathcal {s}}(\mathbb {r} ^{n})}
   is a tvs-automorphism of the schwartz space, and the fourier transform is defined to be its transpose 
  
    
      
        
          

          
          
            t
          
        
        f
        :
        
          
            
              s
            
          
          ′
        
        (
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
        →
        
          
            
              s
            
          
          ′
        
        (
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {}^{t}f:{\mathcal {s}}'(\mathbb {r} ^{n})\to {\mathcal {s}}'(\mathbb {r} ^{n}),}
   which (abusing notation) will again be denoted by 
  
    
      
        f
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f.}
   so the fourier transform of the tempered distribution 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is defined by 
  
    
      
        (
        f
        t
        )
        (
        ψ
        )
        =
        t
        (
        f
        ψ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (ft)(\psi )=t(f\psi )}
   for every schwartz function 
  
    
      
        ψ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi .}
   
  
    
      
        f
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle ft}
   is thus again a tempered distribution. the fourier transform is a tvs isomorphism from the space of tempered distributions onto itself. this operation is compatible with differentiation in the sense that

and also with convolution: if 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is a tempered distribution and 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
   is a slowly increasing smooth function on 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n},}
   
  
    
      
        ψ
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi t}
   is again a tempered distribution and

is the convolution of 
  
    
      
        f
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle ft}
   and 
  
    
      
        f
        ψ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\psi .}
   in particular, the fourier transform of the constant function equal to 1 is the 
  
    
      
        δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta }
   distribution.


==== expressing tempered distributions as sums of derivatives ====

   is a tempered distribution, then there exists a constant

    {\displaystyle \phi \in {\mathcal {s}}(\mathbb {r} ^{n})}
  

this estimate along with some techniques from functional analysis can be used to show that there is a continuous slowly increasing function

== using holomorphic functions as test functions ==
the success of the theory led to investigation of the idea of hyperfunction, in which spaces of holomorphic functions are used as test functions. a refined theory has been developed, in particular mikio sato's algebraic analysis, using sheaf theory and several complex variables. this extends the range of symbolic methods that can be made into rigorous mathematics, for example feynman integrals.
