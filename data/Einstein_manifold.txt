in differential geometry and mathematical physics, an einstein manifold is a riemannian or pseudo-riemannian differentiable manifold whose ricci tensor is proportional to the metric. they are named after albert einstein because this condition is equivalent to saying that the metric is a solution of the vacuum einstein field equations (with cosmological constant), although both the dimension and the signature of the metric can be arbitrary, thus not being restricted to the four-dimensional lorentzian manifolds usually studied in general relativity. einstein manifolds in four euclidean dimensions are studied as gravitational instantons.
if m is the underlying n-dimensional manifold, and g is its metric tensor, the einstein condition means that

  
    
      
        
          r
          i
          c
        
        =
        k
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {ric} =kg}
  for some constant k, where ric denotes the ricci tensor of g. einstein manifolds with k = 0 are called ricci-flat manifolds.


== the einstein condition and einstein's equation ==
in local coordinates the condition that (m, g) be an einstein manifold is simply

  
    
      
        
          r
          
            a
            b
          
        
        =
        k
        
          g
          
            a
            b
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{ab}=kg_{ab}.}
  taking the trace of both sides reveals that the constant of proportionality k for einstein manifolds is related to the scalar curvature r by

  
    
      
        r
        =
        n
        k
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=nk,}
  where n is the dimension of m.
in general relativity, einstein's equation with a cosmological constant λ is

  
    
      
        
          r
          
            a
            b
          
        
        −
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        
          g
          
            a
            b
          
        
        r
        +
        
          g
          
            a
            b
          
        
        λ
        =
        κ
        
          t
          
            a
            b
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{ab}-{\frac {1}{2}}g_{ab}r+g_{ab}\lambda =\kappa t_{ab},}
  where κ is the einstein gravitational constant. the stress–energy tensor tab gives the matter and energy content of the underlying spacetime. in vacuum (a region of spacetime devoid of matter) tab = 0, and einstein's equation can be rewritten in the form (assuming that n > 2):

  
    
      
        
          r
          
            a
            b
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              2
              λ
            
            
              n
              −
              2
            
          
        
        
        
          g
          
            a
            b
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{ab}={\frac {2\lambda }{n-2}}\,g_{ab}.}
  therefore, vacuum solutions of einstein's equation are (lorentzian) einstein manifolds with k proportional to the cosmological constant.

simple examples of einstein manifolds include:

any manifold with constant sectional curvature is an einstein manifold—in particular:
euclidean space, which is flat, is a simple example of ricci-flat, hence einstein metric.

calabi–yau manifolds admit an einstein metric that is also kähler, with einstein constant 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=0}
  . such metrics are not unique, but rather come in families; there is a calabi–yau metric in every kähler class, and the metric also depends on the choice of complex structure. for example, there is a 60-parameter family of such metrics on k3, 57 parameters of which give rise to einstein metrics which are not related by isometries or rescalings.
kähler–einstein metrics exist on a variety of compact complex manifolds due to the existence results of shing-tung yau, and the later study of k-stability especially in the case of fano manifolds.a necessary condition for closed, oriented, 4-manifolds to be einstein is satisfying the hitchin–thorpe inequality.


== applications ==
four dimensional riemannian einstein manifolds are also important in mathematical physics as gravitational instantons in quantum theories of gravity. the term "gravitational instanton" is usually used restricted to einstein 4-manifolds whose weyl tensor is self-dual, and it is usually assumed that the metric is asymptotic to the standard metric of euclidean 4-space (and are therefore complete but non-compact). in differential geometry, self-dual einstein 4-manifolds are also known as (4-dimensional) hyperkähler manifolds in the ricci-flat case, and quaternion kähler manifolds otherwise.
higher-dimensional lorentzian einstein manifolds are used in modern theories of gravity, such as string theory, m-theory and supergravity. hyperkähler and quaternion kähler manifolds (which are special kinds of einstein manifolds) also have applications in physics as target spaces for nonlinear σ-models with supersymmetry.
compact einstein manifolds have been much studied in differential geometry, and many examples are known, although constructing them is often challenging. compact ricci-flat manifolds are particularly difficult to find: in the monograph on the subject by the pseudonymous author arthur besse, readers are offered a meal in a starred restaurant in exchange for a new example.
