in knot theory, a branch of mathematics, the trefoil knot is the simplest example of a nontrivial knot. the trefoil can be obtained by joining together the two loose ends of a common overhand knot, resulting in a knotted loop. as the simplest knot, the trefoil is fundamental to the study of mathematical knot theory.
the trefoil knot is named after the three-leaf clover (or trefoil) plant.

any continuous deformation of the curve above is also considered a trefoil knot. specifically, any curve isotopic to a trefoil knot is also considered to be a trefoil. in addition, the mirror image of a trefoil knot is also considered to be a trefoil. in topology and knot theory, the trefoil is usually defined using a knot diagram instead of an explicit parametric equation.
in algebraic geometry, the trefoil can also be obtained as the intersection in c2 of the unit 3-sphere s3 with the complex plane curve of zeroes of the complex polynomial z2 + w3 (a cuspidal cubic).

if one end of a tape or belt is turned over three times and then pasted to the other, the edge forms a trefoil knot.


== symmetry ==
the trefoil knot is chiral, in the sense that a trefoil knot can be distinguished from its own mirror image. the two resulting variants are known as the left-handed trefoil and the right-handed trefoil. it is not possible to deform a left-handed trefoil continuously into a right-handed trefoil, or vice versa. (that is, the two trefoils are not ambient isotopic.)
though chiral, the trefoil knot is also invertible, meaning that there is no distinction between a counterclockwise-oriented and a clockwise-oriented trefoil. that is, the chirality of a trefoil depends only on the over and under crossings, not the orientation of the curve.


== nontriviality ==
the trefoil knot is nontrivial, meaning that it is not possible to "untie" a trefoil knot in three dimensions without cutting it. mathematically, this means that a trefoil knot is not isotopic to the unknot. in particular, there is no sequence of reidemeister moves that will untie a trefoil.
proving this requires the construction of a knot invariant that distinguishes the trefoil from the unknot. the simplest such invariant is tricolorability: the trefoil is tricolorable, but the unknot is not. in addition, virtually every major knot polynomial distinguishes the trefoil from an unknot, as do most other strong knot invariants.


== classification ==
in knot theory, the trefoil is the first nontrivial knot, and is the only knot with crossing number three. it is a prime knot, and is listed as 31 in the alexander-briggs notation. the dowker notation for the trefoil is 4 6 2, and the conway notation is [3].
the trefoil can be described as the (2,3)-torus knot. it is also the knot obtained by closing the braid σ13.
the trefoil is an alternating knot. however, it is not a slice knot, meaning it does not bound a smooth 2-dimensional disk in the 4-dimensional ball; one way to prove this is to note that its signature is not zero. another proof is that its alexander polynomial does not satisfy the fox-milnor condition.
the trefoil is a fibered knot, meaning that its complement in

as the simplest nontrivial knot, the trefoil is a common motif in iconography and the visual arts. for example, the common form of the triquetra symbol is a trefoil, as are some versions of the germanic valknut.

in modern art, the woodcut knots by m. c. escher depicts three trefoil knots whose solid forms are twisted in different ways.
