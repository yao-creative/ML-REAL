in functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, fréchet spaces, named after maurice fréchet, are special topological vector spaces. 
they are generalizations of banach spaces (normed vector spaces that are complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm). 
all banach and hilbert spaces are fréchet spaces. 
spaces of infinitely differentiable functions are typical examples of fréchet spaces, many of which are typically not banach spaces. 
a fréchet space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is defined to be a locally convex metrizable topological vector space (tvs) that is complete as a tvs, meaning that every cauchy sequence in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   converges to some point in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (see footnote for more details).
important note: not all authors require that a fréchet space be locally convex (discussed below).the topology of every fréchet space is induced by some translation-invariant complete metric. 
conversely, if the topology of a locally convex space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is induced by a translation-invariant complete metric then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a fréchet space. 
fréchet was the first to use the term "banach space" and banach in turn then coined the term "fréchet space" to mean a complete metrizable topological vector space, without the local convexity requirement (such a space is today often called an "f-space"). 
the condition of locally convex was added later by nicolas bourbaki. 
it's important to note that a sizable number of authors (e.g. schaefer) use "f-space" to mean a (locally convex) fréchet space while others do not require that a "fréchet space" be locally convex. 
moreover, some authors even use "f-space" and "fréchet space" interchangeably. 
when reading mathematical literature, it is recommended that a reader always check whether the book's or article's definition of "f-space" and "fréchet space" requires local convexity.


== definitions ==
fréchet spaces can be defined in two equivalent ways: the first employs a translation-invariant metric, the second a countable family of seminorms.


=== invariant metric definition ===
a topological vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a fréchet space if and only if it satisfies the following three properties:

it is locally convex.
its topology can be induced by a translation-invariant metric, that is, a metric 
  
    
      
        d
        :
        x
        ×
        x
        →
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle d:x\times x\to \mathbb {r} }
   such that 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        d
        (
        x
        +
        z
        ,
        y
        +
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(x,y)=d(x+z,y+z)}
   for all 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        ∈
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y,z\in x.}
   this means that a subset 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is open if and only if for every 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in u}
   there exists an 
  
    
      
        r
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle r>0}
   such that 
  
    
      
        {
        v
        :
        d
        (
        v
        ,
        u
        )
        <
        r
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{v:d(v,u)<r\}}
  } is a subset of 
  
    
      
        u
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle u.}
  
some (or equivalently, every) translation-invariant metric on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   inducing the topology of  
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is complete. 
assuming that the other two conditions are satisfied, this condition is equivalent to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   being a complete topological vector space, meaning that 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a complete uniform space when it is endowed with its canonical uniformity (this canonical uniformity is independent of any metric on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and is defined entirely in terms of vector subtraction and 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  's neighborhoods of the origin; moreover, the uniformity induced by any (topology-defining) translation invariant metric on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is identical to this canonical uniformity).note there is no natural notion of distance between two points of a fréchet space: many different translation-invariant metrics may induce the same topology.


=== countable family of seminorms definition ===
the alternative and somewhat more practical definition is the following: a topological vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a fréchet space if and only if it satisfies the following three properties:

it is a hausdorff space,
its topology may be induced by a countable family of seminorms 
  
    
      
        
          |

        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=0,1,2,\ldots }
   this means that a subset 
  
    
      
        u
        ⊆
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\subseteq x}
   is open if and only if for every 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in u}
   there exists

it is complete with respect to the family of seminorms.a family

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   with respect to each of the given seminorms.


=== as webbed baire spaces ===


=== comparison to banach spaces ===
in contrast to banach spaces, the complete translation-invariant metric need not arise from a norm. 
the topology of a fréchet space does, however, arise from both a total paranorm and an f-norm (the f stands for fréchet). 
even though the topological structure of fréchet spaces is more complicated than that of banach spaces due to the potential lack of a norm, many important results in functional analysis, like the open mapping theorem, the closed graph theorem, and the banach–steinhaus theorem, still hold.


== constructing fréchet spaces ==
recall that a seminorm 
  
    
      
        ‖
        ⋅
        ‖
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|}
   is a function from a vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to the real numbers satisfying three properties. 
for all 
  
    
      
        x
        ,

        ∈
        x

   and all scalars 
  
    
      
        c
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle c,}

    {\displaystyle \|x\|=0\iff x=0}
   then 
  
    
      
        ‖
        ⋅
        ‖
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|}
   is in fact a norm. 
however, seminorms are useful in that they enable us to construct fréchet spaces, as follows:
to construct a fréchet space, one typically starts with a vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and defines a countable family of seminorms

   is a sequence in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   which is cauchy with respect to each seminorm

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in x}
   such that

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|_{k}.}
  then the topology induced by these seminorms (as explained above) turns 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   into a fréchet space; the first property ensures that it is hausdorff, and the second property ensures that it is complete. 
a translation-invariant complete metric inducing the same topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   can then be defined by

the function 
  
    
      
        u
        ↦
        
          
            u
            
              1
              +
              u
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\mapsto {\frac {u}{1+u}}}
   maps 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        ∞
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\infty )}
   monotonically to 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        1
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1),}
   and so the above definition ensures that 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(x,y)}
   is "small" if and only if there exists 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   "large" such that 
  
    
      
        ‖
        x
        −
        y
        
          ‖
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|x-y\|_{k}}
   is "small" for 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        0
        ,
        …

        k
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=0,\ldots ,k.}

a closed subspace of a fréchet space is a fréchet space. 
a quotient of a fréchet space by a closed subspace is a fréchet space. 
the direct sum of a finite number of fréchet spaces is a fréchet space. 
a product of countably many fréchet spaces is always once again a fréchet space. however, an arbitrary product of fréchet spaces will be a fréchet space if and only if all except for at most countably many of them are trivial (that is, have dimension 0). consequently, a product of uncountably many non-trivial fréchet spaces can not be a fréchet space (indeed, such a product is not even metrizable because its origin can not have a countable neighborhood basis). so for example, if 
  
    
      
        i

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is any non-trivial fréchet space (such as 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\mathbb {r} }
   for instance), then the product 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{i}=\prod _{i\in i}x}

        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   is a countable set. 
several important tools of functional analysis which are based on the baire category theorem remain true in fréchet spaces; examples are the closed graph theorem and the open mapping theorem. 
the open mapping theorem implies that if 
  
    
      
        τ
        
           and

    {\displaystyle \left(x,\tau _{2}\right)}
   into complete metrizable tvss (such as fréchet spaces) and if one topology is finer or coarser than the other then they must be equal (that is, if

  ).every bounded linear operator from a fréchet space into another topological vector space (tvs) is continuous.there exists a fréchet space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   having a bounded subset 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   and also a dense vector subspace

   such that 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   is not contained in the closure (in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  ) of any bounded subset of 
  
    
      
        m
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m.}
  all fréchet spaces are stereotype spaces. in the theory of stereotype spaces fréchet spaces are dual objects to brauner spaces. 
all metrizable montel spaces are separable. a separable fréchet space is a montel space if and only if each weak-* convergent sequence in its continuous dual converges is strongly convergent.the strong dual space

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a df-space. 
the strong dual of a df-space is a fréchet space. 
the strong dual of a reflexive fréchet space is a bornological space and a ptak space. every fréchet space is a ptak space. 
the strong bidual (that is, the strong dual space of the strong dual space) of a metrizable locally convex space is a fréchet space.


=== norms and normability ===

if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a locally convex space then the topology of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   can be a defined by a family of continuous norms on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (a norm is a positive-definite seminorm) if and only if there exists at least one continuous norm on 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   
even if a fréchet space has a topology that is defined by a (countable) family of norms (all norms are also seminorms), then it may nevertheless still fail to be normable space (meaning that its topology can not be defined by any single norm). 
the space of all sequences 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
          
          
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} ^{\mathbb {n} }}
   (with the product topology) is a fréchet space. there does not exist any hausdorff locally convex topology on 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
          
          
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} ^{\mathbb {n} }}
   that is strictly coarser than this product topology. 
the space 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
          
          
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} ^{\mathbb {n} }}
   is not normable, which means that its topology can not be defined by any norm. also, there does not exist any continuous norm on 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
          
          
            
              n
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} ^{\mathbb {n} }.}
   in fact, as the following theorem shows, whenever 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a fréchet space on which there does not exist any continuous norm, then this is due entirely to the presence of 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
          
          
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} ^{\mathbb {n} }}
   as a subspace. 

if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a non-normable fréchet space on which there exists a continuous norm, then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   contains a closed vector subspace that has no topological complement.a metrizable locally convex space is normable if and only if its strong dual space is a fréchet–urysohn locally convex space. in particular, if a locally convex metrizable space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (such as a fréchet space) is not normable (which can only happen if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is infinite dimensional) then its strong dual space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   is not a fréchet–urysohn space and consequently, this complete hausdorff locally convex space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   is also neither metrizable nor normable.
the strong dual space of a fréchet space (and more generally, of bornological spaces such as metrizable tvss) is always a complete tvs and so like any complete tvs, it is normable if and only if its topology can be induced by a complete norm (that is, if and only if it can be made into a banach space that has the same topology). 
if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a fréchet space then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is normable if (and only if) there exists a complete norm on its continuous dual space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x'}
   such that the norm induced topology on 
  
    
      
        
          x
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x'}
   is finer than the weak-* topology. 
consequently, if a fréchet space is not normable (which can only happen if it is infinite dimensional) then neither is its strong dual space. 


=== anderson–kadec theorem ===

note that the homeomorphism described in the anderson–kadec theorem is not necessarily linear. 


== differentiation of functions ==

if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are fréchet spaces, then the space 
  
    
      
        l
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l(x,y)}
   consisting of all continuous linear maps from 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   is not a fréchet space in any natural manner. this is a major difference between the theory of banach spaces and that of fréchet spaces and necessitates a different definition for continuous differentiability of functions defined on fréchet spaces, the gateaux derivative:
suppose 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is an open subset of a fréchet space 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   
  
    
      
        p
        :
        u
        →

    {\displaystyle p:u\to y}
   is a function valued in a fréchet space

   the map 
  
    
      
        p

   is differentiable at 
  
    
      
        x

   in the direction 
  
    
      
        h

exists. 
the map 
  
    
      
        p

   is said to be continuously differentiable in 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   if the map

is continuous. since the product of fréchet spaces is again a fréchet space, we can then try to differentiate 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(p)}
   and define the higher derivatives of 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   in this fashion. 
the derivative operator 
  
    
      
        p
        :
        
          c

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p:c^{\infty }([0,1])\to c^{\infty }([0,1])}
   defined by 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        f
        )
        =
        
          f

    {\displaystyle p(f)=f'}
   is itself infinitely differentiable. the first derivative is given by

for any two elements 
  
    
      
        f
        ,
        h
        ∈

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f,h\in c^{\infty }([0,1]).}
   
this is a major advantage of the fréchet space

        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle p:u\to y}
   is a continuously differentiable function, then the differential equation

need not have any solutions, and even if does, the solutions need not be unique. this is in stark contrast to the situation in banach spaces. 
in general, the inverse function theorem is not true in fréchet spaces, although a partial substitute is the nash–moser theorem.


== fréchet manifolds and lie groups ==

one may define fréchet manifolds as spaces that "locally look like" fréchet spaces (just like ordinary manifolds are defined as spaces that locally look like euclidean space 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
  ), and one can then extend the concept of lie group to these manifolds. 
this is useful because for a given (ordinary) compact 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c^{\infty }}
   manifold 
  
    
      
        m
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle m,}
   the set of all 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c^{\infty }}
   diffeomorphisms 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        m
        →
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:m\to m}
   forms a generalized lie group in this sense, and this lie group captures the symmetries of 
  
    
      
        m
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m.}
   
some of the relations between lie algebras and lie groups remain valid in this setting.
another important example of a fréchet lie group is the loop group of a compact lie group 
  
    
      
        g
        ,

== generalizations ==
if we drop the requirement for the space to be locally convex, we obtain f-spaces: vector spaces with complete translation-invariant metrics.
lf-spaces are countable inductive limits of fréchet spaces.
