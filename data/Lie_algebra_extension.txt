in the theory of lie groups, lie algebras and their representation theory, a lie algebra extension e is an enlargement of a given lie algebra g by another lie algebra h. extensions arise in several ways. there is the trivial extension obtained by taking a direct sum of two lie algebras. other types are the split extension and the central extension. extensions may arise naturally, for instance, when forming a lie algebra from projective group representations. such a lie algebra will contain central charges.
starting with a polynomial loop algebra over finite-dimensional simple lie algebra and performing two extensions, a central extension and an extension by a derivation, one obtains a lie algebra which is isomorphic with an untwisted affine kac–moody algebra. using the centrally extended loop algebra one may construct a current algebra in two spacetime dimensions. the virasoro algebra is the universal central extension of the witt algebra.central extensions are needed in physics, because the symmetry group of a quantized system usually is a central extension of the classical symmetry group, and in the same way the corresponding symmetry lie algebra of the quantum system is, in general, a central extension of the classical symmetry algebra. kac–moody algebras have been conjectured to be symmetry groups of a unified superstring theory. the centrally extended lie algebras play a dominant role in quantum field theory, particularly in conformal field theory, string theory and in m-theory.a large portion towards the end is devoted to background material for applications of lie algebra extensions, both in mathematics and in physics, in areas where they are actually useful. a parenthetical link, (background material), is provided where it might be beneficial.


== history ==
due to the lie correspondence, the theory, and consequently the history of lie algebra extensions, is tightly linked to the theory and history of group extensions. a systematic study of group extensions was performed by the austrian mathematician otto schreier in 1923 in his phd thesis and later published. the problem posed for his thesis  by otto hölder was "given two groups g and h, find all groups e having a normal subgroup n isomorphic to g such that the factor group e/n is isomorphic to h".
lie algebra extensions are most interesting and useful for infinite-dimensional lie algebras. in 1967, victor kac and robert moody independently generalized the notion of classical lie algebras, resulting in a new theory of infinite-dimensional lie algebras, now called kac–moody algebras. they generalize the finite-dimensional simple lie algebras and can often concretely be constructed as extensions.


== notation and proofs ==
notational abuse to be found below includes ex for the exponential map exp given an argument, writing g for the element (g, eh) in a direct product g × h (eh is the identity in h), and analogously for lie algebra direct sums (where also g + h and (g, h) are used interchangeably). likewise for semidirect products and semidirect sums. canonical injections (both for groups and lie algebras) are used for implicit identifications. furthermore, if g, h, ..., are groups, then the default names for elements of g, h, ..., are g, h, ..., and their lie algebras are g, h, ... . the default names for elements of g, h, ..., are g, h, ... (just like for the groups!), partly to save scarce alphabetical resources but mostly to have a uniform notation.
lie algebras that are ingredients in an extension will, without comment, be taken to be over the same field.
the summation convention applies, including sometimes when the indices involved are both upstairs or both downstairs.
caveat: not all proofs and proof outlines below have universal validity. the main reason is that the lie algebras are often infinite-dimensional, and then there may or may not be a lie group corresponding to the lie algebra. moreover, even if such a group exists, it may not have the "usual" properties, e.g. the exponential map might not exist, and if it does, it might not have all the "usual" properties. in such cases, it is questionable whether the group should be endowed with the "lie" qualifier. the literature is not uniform. for the explicit examples, the relevant structures are supposedly in place.


== definition ==
lie algebra extensions are formalized in terms of short exact sequences. a short exact sequence is an exact sequence of length three,

such that i is a monomorphism, s is an epimorphism, and ker s = im i. from these properties of exact sequences, it follows that (the image of) h is an ideal in e. moreover, 

  
    
      
        
          
            g
          
        
        ≅
        
          
            e
          
        
        
          /
        
        im
        ⁡
        i
        =
        
          
            e
          
        
        
          /
        
        ker
        ⁡
        s
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}\cong {\mathfrak {e}}/\operatorname {im} i={\mathfrak {e}}/\operatorname {ker} s,}
  but it is not necessarily the case that g is isomorphic to a subalgebra of e. this construction mirrors the analogous constructions in the closely related concept of group extensions.
if the situation in (1) prevails, non-trivially and for lie algebras over the same field, then one says that e is an extension of g by h.


== properties ==
the defining property may be reformulated. the lie algebra e is an extension of g by h if

is exact. here the zeros on the ends represent the zero lie algebra (containing the null vector ∅ only) and the maps are the obvious ones; ί maps ∅ to ∅ and σ maps all elements of g to ∅. with this definition, it follows automatically that i is a monomorphism and s is an epimorphism.
an extension of g by h is not necessarily unique. let e, e' denote two extensions and let the primes below have the obvious interpretation. then, if there exists a lie algebra isomorphism f:e → e' such that

  
    
      
        f
        ∘
        i
        =
        
          i
          ′
        
        ,
        
        
          s
          ′
        
        ∘
        f
        =
        s
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\circ i=i',\quad s'\circ f=s,}
  
then the extensions e and e' are said to be equivalent extensions. equivalence of extensions is an equivalence relation.

    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {h}}\;{\overset {i}{\hookrightarrow }}\;{\mathfrak {t}}\;{\overset {s}{\twoheadrightarrow }}\;{\mathfrak {g}},}
  is trivial if there is a subspace i such that t = i ⊕ ker s and i is an ideal in t.


=== split ===
a lie algebra extension

  
    
      
        
          
            h
          
        
        
        
          
            ↪
            i
          
        
        
        
          
            s
          
        
        
        
          
            ↠
            s
          
        
        
        
          
            g
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {h}}\;{\overset {i}{\hookrightarrow }}\;{\mathfrak {s}}\;{\overset {s}{\twoheadrightarrow }}\;{\mathfrak {g}},}
  is split if there is a subspace u such that s = u ⊕ ker s as a vector space and u is a subalgebra in s.
an ideal is a subalgebra, but a subalgebra is not necessarily an ideal. a trivial extension is thus a split extension.


=== central ===
central extensions of a lie algebra g by an abelian lie algebra a can be obtained with the help of a so-called (nontrivial) 2-cocycle (background) on g. non-trivial 2-cocycles occur in the context of projective representations (background) of lie groups. this is alluded to further down.

  is a central extension if ker s is contained in the center z(c) of c.
properties

since the center commutes with everything, h ≅ im i = ker s in this case is abelian.
given a central extension e of g, one may construct a 2-cocycle on g. suppose e is a central extension of g by h. let l be a linear map from g to e with the property that s ∘ l = idg, i.e. l is a section of s. use this section to define ε: g × g → e by

  to see this, use the definition of ε on the left hand side, then use the linearity of l. use jacobi identity on g to get rid of half of the six terms. use the definition of ε again on terms l([gi,gj]) sitting inside three lie brackets, bilinearity of lie brackets, and the jacobi identity on e, and then finally use on the three remaining terms that im ε ⊂ ker s and that ker s ⊂ z(e) so that ε(gi, gj) brackets to zero with everything.
it then follows that φ = i−1 ∘ ε satisfies the corresponding relation, and if h in addition is one-dimensional, then φ is a 2-cocycle on g (via a trivial correspondence of h with the underlying field).

=== by semidirect sum ===
inspired by the construction of a semidirect product (background) of groups using a homomorphism g → aut(h), one can make the corresponding construct for lie algebras.
if ψ:g → der h is a lie algebra homomorphism, then define a lie bracket on 
  
    
      
        
          
            e
          
        
        =
        
          
            h
          
        
        ⊕
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {e}}={\mathfrak {h}}\oplus {\mathfrak {g}}}
   by

with this lie bracket, the lie algebra so obtained is denoted e= h ⊕s g and is called the semidirect sum of h and g.
by inspection of (7) one sees that 0 ⊕ g is a subalgebra of e and h ⊕ 0 is an ideal in e. define i:h → e by h ↦ h ⊕ 0 and s:e → g by h ⊕ g ↦ g, h ∈ h, g ∈ g. it is clear that ker s = im i. thus e is a lie algebra extension of g by h.
as with the trivial extension, this property generalizes to the definition of a split extension.

  it is obvious from the definition of the bracket that h is and ideal in e in and that g is a subalgebra of e. furthermore, g is complementary to h in e. let i:h → e be given by h ↦ (0, h) and s:e → g by (g, h) ↦ g. it is clear that im i = ker s. thus e is a split extension of g by h. such an extension is called extension by a derivation.
if ψ: g → der h is defined by ψ(μδ)(h) = μδ(h), then ψ is a lie algebra homomorphism into der h. hence this construction is a special case of a semidirect sum, for when starting from ψ and using the construction in the preceding section, the same lie brackets result.

  here h is an arbitrary but fixed element of h. antisymmetry follows from antisymmetry of the lie bracket on g and antisymmetry of the 2-cocycle. the jacobi identity follows from the corresponding properties of g and of ε. thus e is a lie algebra. put g1 = 0 and it follows that μh ∈ z(e). also, it follows with i: μh ↦ (μh, 0) and s: (μh, g) ↦ g that im i = ker s = {(μh, 0):μ ∈ f} ⊂ z(e). hence e is a central extension of g by h. it is called extension by a 2-cocycle.

below follows some results regarding central extensions and 2-cocycles.theorem
let φ1 and φ2 be cohomologous 2-cocycles on a lie algebra g and let e1 and e2 be respectively the central extensions constructed with these 2-cocycles. then the central extensions e1 and e2 are equivalent extensions.proof

  it follows from the definitions that ψ is a lie algebra isomorphism and (2) holds.
corollary
a cohomology class [φ] ∈ h2(g, f) defines a central extension of g which is unique up to isomorphism.
the trivial 2-cocycle gives the trivial extension, and since a 2-coboundary is cohomologous with the trivial 2-cocycle, one has corollary
a central extension defined by a coboundary is equivalent with a trivial central extension.
theorem
a finite-dimensional simple lie algebra has only trivial central extensions.proof
since every central extension comes from a 2-cocycle φ, it suffices to show that every 2-cocycle is a coboundary. suppose φ is a 2-cocycle on g. the task is to use this 2-cocycle to manufacture a 1-cochain f such that φ = δf.
the first step is to for each gg1 ∈ g use φ to define a linear map ρg1:g → f. but the linear maps are elements of g∗. this suffices to express φ in terms of k, using the isomorphism ν. next, a linear map d:g → g is defined that turns out to be a derivation. since all derivations are inner, one has d = adgd for some gd ∈ g. an expression for φ in terms of k and d is obtained. thus set, trusting that d is a derivation,

if g is the lie algebra of a lie group g and e is a central extension of g, one may ask whether there is a lie group e with lie algebra e. the answer is, by lie's third theorem affirmative. but is there a central extension e of g with lie algebra e? the answer to this question requires some machinery, and can be found in tuynman & wiegerinck (1987, theorem 5.4).


== applications ==
the "negative" result of the preceding theorem indicates that one must, at least for semisimple lie algebras, go to infinite-dimensional lie algebras to find useful applications of central extensions. there are indeed such. here will be presented affine kac–moody algebras and virasoro algebras. these are extensions of polynomial loop-algebras and the witt algebra respectively.

  where g0 is a complex finite-dimensional simple lie algebra. the goal is to find a central extension of this algebra. two of the theorems apply. on the one hand, if there is a 2-cocycle on g, then a central extension may be defined. on the other hand, if this 2-cocycle is acting on the g0 part (only), then the resulting extension is trivial. moreover, derivations acting on g0 (only) cannot be used for definition of a 2-cocycle either because these derivations are all inner and the same problem results. one therefore looks for derivations on c[λ, λ−1]. one such set of derivations is

  this is a universal central extension of the polynomial loop algebra.
a note on terminologyin physics terminology, the algebra of above might pass for a kac–moody algebra, whilst it will probably not in mathematics terminology. an additional dimension, an extension by a derivation is required for this. nonetheless, if, in a physical application, the eigenvalues of g0 or its representative are interpreted as (ordinary) quantum numbers, the additional superscript on the generators is referred to as the level. it is an additional quantum number. an additional operator whose eigenvalues are precisely the levels is introduced further below.


=== current algebra ===

as an application of a central extension of polynomial loop algebra, a current algebra of a quantum field theory is considered (background). suppose one has a current algebra, with the interesting commutator being

with a schwinger term. to construct this algebra mathematically, let g be the centrally extended polynomial loop algebra of the previous section with

  since the delta functions arguments only ensure that the arguments of the left and right arguments of the commutator are equal (formally δ(z) = δ(z − 0) ↦  δ((x −y) − 0) = δ(x −y)).
by comparison with ca10, this is a current algebra in two spacetime dimensions, including a schwinger term, with the space dimension curled up into a circle. in the classical setting of quantum field theory, this is perhaps of little use, but with the advent of string theory where fields live on world sheets of strings, and spatial dimensions are curled up, there may be relevant applications.

  these are precisely the short-hand description of an untwisted affine kac–moody algebra. to recapitulate, begin with a finite-dimensional simple lie algebra. define a space of formal laurent polynomials with coefficients in the finite-dimensional simple lie algebra. with the support of a symmetric non-degenerate alternating bilinear form and a derivation, a 2-cocycle is defined, subsequently used in the standard prescription for a central extension by a 2-cocycle. extend the derivation to this new space, use the standard prescription for a split extension by a derivation and an untwisted affine kac–moody algebra obtains.

==== bosonic open strings ====

the relativistic classical open string (background) is subject to quantization. this roughly amounts to taking the position and the momentum of the string and promoting them to operators on the space of states of open strings. since strings are extended objects, this results in a continuum of operators depending on the parameter σ. the following commutation relations are postulated in the heisenberg picture.

because of the continuum of operators, and because of the delta functions, it is desirable to express these relations instead in terms of the quantized versions of the virasoro modes, the virasoro operators. these are calculated to satisfy

  they are interpreted as creation and annihilation operators acting on hilbert space, increasing or decreasing the quantum of their respective modes. if the index is negative, the operator is a creation operator, otherwise it is an annihilation operator. (if it is zero, it is proportional to the total momentum operator.) in view of the fact that the light cone plus and minus modes were expressed in terms of the transverse virasoro modes, one must consider the commutation relations between the virasoro operators. these were classically defined (then modes) as

  upon identification of the generic central term as (d − 2) times the identity operator, this is the virasoro algebra, the universal central extension of the witt algebra.
the operator l0 enters the theory as the hamiltonian, modulo an additive constant. moreover, the virasoro operators enter into the definition of the lorentz generators of the theory. it is perhaps the most important algebra in string theory. the consistency of the lorentz generators, by the way, fixes the spacetime dimensionality to 26. while this theory presented here (for relative simplicity of exposition) is unphysical, or at the very least incomplete (it has, for instance, no fermions) the virasoro algebra arises in the same way in the more viable superstring theory and m-theory.


=== group extension ===

a projective representation π(g) of a lie group g (background) can be used to define a so-called group extension gex.
in quantum mechanics, wigner's theorem asserts that if g is a symmetry group, then it will be represented projectively on hilbert space by unitary or antiunitary operators. this is often dealt with by passing to the universal covering group of g and take it as the symmetry group. this works nicely for the rotation group so(3) and the lorentz group o(3, 1), but it does not work when the symmetry group is the galilean group. in this case one has to pass to its central extension, the bargmann group, which is the symmetry group of the schrödinger equation. likewise, if g =

  moreover, in the same way that g is a symmetry of ph preserving [·,·], gex is a symmetry of sh preserving (·,·). the fibers of π2 are all circles. these circles are left invariant under the action of u(1). the action of u(1) on these fibers is transitive with no fixed point. the conclusion is that sh is a principal fiber bundle over ph with structure group u(1).

  and differentiate the rhs of this expression. it is, using (a), identically zero. hence the rhs of this expression is independent of t and equals its value for t = 0, which is the lhs of this expression.
if g ∈ g, then adg, acting by adg1(g2) = [g1, g2], is a derivation. the set adg: g ∈ g is the set of inner derivations on g. for finite-dimensional simple lie algebras all derivations are inner derivations.


=== semidirect product (groups) ===

consider two lie groups g and h and aut h, the automorphism group of h. the latter is the group of isomorphisms of h. if there is a lie group homomorphism φ:g → aut h, then for each g ∈ g there is a φ(g) ≡ φg ∈ aut h with the property φgg' = φgφg', g,g' ∈ g. denote with e the set h × g and define multiplication by 

then e is a group with identity (eh, eg) and the inverse is given by (h, g)−1 = (φg−1(h−1), g−1). using the expression for the inverse and equation (4) it is seen that h is normal in e. denote the group with this semidirect product as e = h ⊗s g.
conversely, if e = h ⊗s g is a given semidirect product expression of the group e, then by definition h is normal in e and cg ∈ aut h for each g ∈ g where cg (h) ≡ ghg−1 and the map φ:g ↦ cg is a homomorphism.
now make use of the lie correspondence. the maps φg:h → h, g ∈ g each induce, at the level of lie algebras, a map ψg:h → h. this map is computed by

for instance, if g and  h are both subgroups of a larger group e and φg = ghg−1, then 

and one recognizes ψ as the adjoint action ad of e on h restricted to g. now ψ:g → aut h [ ⊂ gl(h) if h is finite-dimensional] is a homomorphism, and appealing once more to the lie correspondence, there is a unique lie algebra homomorphism ψ:g → lie(aut h) = der h ⊂ gl(h). this map is (formally) given by

for example, if ψ = ad, then (formally)

where a relationship between ad and the adjoint action ad rigorously proved in here is used.
lie algebra
the lie algebra is, as a vector space, e = h ⊕ g. this is clear since gh generates e and g ∩ h = (eh, eg). the lie bracket is given by

=== cohomology ===

for the present purposes, consideration of a limited portion of the theory lie algebra cohomology suffices. the definitions are not the most general possible, or even the most common ones, but the objects they refer to are authentic instances of more the general definitions.
2-cocycles
the objects of primary interest are the 2-cocycles on g, defined as bilinear alternating functions, 

  
    
      
        ϕ
        :
        
          
            g
          
        
        ×
        
          
            g
          
        
        →
        f
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :{\mathfrak {g}}\times {\mathfrak {g}}\rightarrow f,}
  that are alternating,

  
    
      
        ϕ
        (
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          g

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi (g_{1},g_{2})=-\phi (g_{2},g_{1}),}
  and having a property resembling the jacobi identity called the jacobi identity for 2-cycles,

  
    
      
        ϕ
        (
        
          g
          
            1

        ]
        )
        +

        )
        +
        ϕ
        (
        
          g
          
            3
          
        
        ,
        [
        
          g
          
            1

    {\displaystyle \phi (g_{1},[g_{2},g_{3}])+\phi (g_{2},[g_{3},g_{1}])+\phi (g_{3},[g_{1},g_{2}])=0.}
  the set of all 2-cocycles on g is denoted z2(g, f).
2-cocycles from 1-cochains
some 2-cocycles can be obtained from 1-cochains. a 1-cochain on g is simply a linear map,

  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          
            g
          
        
        →
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:{\mathfrak {g}}\rightarrow f}
  the set of all such maps is denoted c1(g, f) and, of course (in at least the finite-dimensional case) c1(g, f) ≅ g*. using a 1-cochain f, a 2-cocycle δf may be defined by

  
    
      
        δ
        f
        (
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
        )
        =
        f
        (
        [
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
        ]
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta f(g_{1},g_{2})=f([g_{1},g_{2}]).}
  the alternating property is immediate and the jacobi identity for 2-cocycles is (as usual) shown by writing it out and using the definition and properties of the ingredients (here the jacobi identity on g and the linearity of f). the linear map δ:c1(g, f) → z2(g, f) is called the coboundary operator (here restricted to c1(g, f)).
the second cohomology group
denote the image of c1(g, f) of δ by b2(g, f). the quotient

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            2
          
        
        (
        
          
            g
          
        
        ,
        
          f
        
        )
        =

        (
        
          
            g
          
        
        ,
        
          f
        
        )
        
          /
        
        
          b
          
            2
          
        
        (
        
          
            g
          
        
        ,
        
          f
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{2}({\mathfrak {g}},\mathbb {f} )=z^{2}({\mathfrak {g}},\mathbb {f} )/b^{2}({\mathfrak {g}},\mathbb {f} )}
  is called the second cohomology group of g. elements of h2(g, f) are equivalence classes of 2-cocycles and two
2-cocycles φ1 and φ2 are called equivalent cocycles if they differ by a 2-coboundary, i.e. if φ1 = φ2 + δf for some f ∈ c1(g, f). equivalent
2-cocycles are called cohomologous. the equivalence class of φ ∈ z2(g, f) is denoted [φ] ∈ h2.
these notions generalize in several directions. for this, see the main articles.

  ) → su(n), etc. one such gauge theory is the u(1) × su(2) × su(3) gauge theory of the standard model with lie algebra u(1) ⊕ su(2) ⊕ su(3).


=== killing form ===

the killing form is a symmetric bilinear form on g defined by

  
    
      
        k
        (
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
        )
        =
        
          t
          r
          a
          c
          e
        
        (
        
          
            a
            d
          
          
            
              g
              
                1
              
            
          
        
        
          
            a
            d
          
          
            
              g
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle k(g_{1},g_{2})=\mathrm {trace} (\mathrm {ad} _{g_{1}}\mathrm {ad} _{g_{2}}).}
  here adg is viewed as a matrix operating on the vector space g. the key fact needed is that if g is semisimple, then, by cartan's criterion, k is non-degenerate. in such a case k may be used to identify g and g∗. if λ ∈ g∗, then there is a ν(λ) = gλ ∈ g such that

  
    
      
        ⟨
        λ
        ,
        g
        ⟩
        =
        k
        (
        
          g
          
            λ
          
        
        ,
        g
        )
        
        ∀
        g
        ∈
        
          
            g
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \lambda ,g\rangle =k(g_{\lambda },g)\quad \forall g\in {\mathfrak {g}}.}
  this is resembling riesz representation theorem and the proof is virtually the same. the killing form has the property

  
    
      
        k
        (
        [
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
        ]
        ,
        
          g
          
            3
          
        
        )
        =
        k
        (
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        [
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        
          g
          
            3
          
        
        ]
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle k([g_{1},g_{2}],g_{3})=k(g_{1},[g_{2},g_{3}]),}
  which is referred to as associativity. by defining gαβ = k[gα,gβ] and expanding the inner brackets in terms of structure constants, one finds that the killing form satisfies the invariance condition of above.


=== loop algebra ===

a loop group is taken as a group of smooth maps from the unit circle s1 into a lie group g with the group structure defined by the group structure on g. the lie algebra of a loop group is then a vector space of mappings from s1 into the lie algebra g of g. any subalgebra of such a lie algebra is referred to as a loop algebra. attention here is focused on polynomial loop algebras of the form

        =

a little thought confirms that these are loops in g as θ goes from 0 to 2π. the operations are the ones defined pointwise by the operations in g. this algebra is isomorphic with the algebra

    {\displaystyle c[\lambda ,\lambda ^{-1}]\otimes {\mathfrak {g}},}
  where c[λ, λ−1] is the algebra of laurent polynomials,

  
    
      
        ∑
        
          λ

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum \lambda ^{k}g_{k}\leftrightarrow \sum \lambda ^{k}\otimes g_{k}.}
  the lie bracket is

  in this latter view the elements can be considered as polynomials with (constant!) coefficients in g. in terms of a basis and structure constants,

    {\displaystyle \lambda ^{m}\otimes g_{i}\cong \lambda ^{m}g_{i}\leftrightarrow t_{i}^{m}(\lambda )\equiv t_{i}^{m},}
  where the omission of λ should be kept in mind to avoid confusion; the elements really are functions s1 → g. the lie bracket is then

which is recognizable as one of the commutation relations in an untwisted affine kac–moody algebra, to be introduced later, without the central term. with m = n = 0, a subalgebra isomorphic to g is obtained. it generates (as seen by tracing backwards in the definitions) the set of constant maps from s1 into g, which is obviously isomorphic with g when exp is onto (which is the case when g is compact. if g is compact, then a basis (gk) for g may be chosen such that the gk are skew-hermitian. as a consequence,

  such a representation is called unitary because the representatives

  are unitary. here, the minus on the lower index of t is conventional, the summation convention applies, and the λ is (by the definition) buried in the ts in the right hand side.


=== current algebra (physics) ===
current algebras arise in quantum field theories as a consequence of global gauge symmetry. conserved currents occur in classical field theories whenever the lagrangian respects a continuous symmetry. this is the content of noether's theorem. most (perhaps all) modern quantum field theories can be formulated in terms of classical lagrangians (prior to quantization), so noether's theorem applies in the quantum case as well. upon quantization, the conserved currents are promoted to position dependent operators on hilbert space. these operators are subject to commutation relations, generally forming an infinite-dimensional lie algebra. a model illustrating this is presented below.
to enhance the flavor of physics, factors of i will appear here and there as opposed to in the mathematical conventions.consider a column vector φ of scalar fields (φ1, φ2, ..., φn). let the lagrangian density be

  the presence of the delta functions and their derivatives is explained by the requirement of microcausality that implies that the commutator vanishes when x ≠ y. thus the commutator must be a distribution supported at x = y. the first term is fixed due to the requirement that the equation should, when integrated over x, reduce to the last equation before it. the following terms are the schwinger terms. they integrate to zero, but it can be shown quite generally that they must be nonzero.

  then there is a lie algebra isomorphism between m and u(m) sending bases to bases, so that u is a faithful representation of m.
if however u(g) is a projective representation, i.e. a representation up to a phase factor, then the lie algebra, as computed from the group representation, is not isomorphic to m. in a projective representation the multiplication rule reads

  so in order for u to be closed under the bracket (and hence have a chance of actually being a lie algebra) a central charge i must be included.


=== relativistic classical string theory ===

a classical relativistic string traces out a world sheet in spacetime, just like a point particle traces out a world line. this world sheet can locally be parametrized using two parameters σ and τ. points xμ in spacetime can, in the range of the parametrization, be written xμ = xμ(σ, τ). one uses a capital x to denote points in spacetime actually being on the world sheet of the string. thus the string parametrization is given by (σ, τ) ↦(x0(σ, τ), x1(σ, τ), x2(σ, τ), x3(σ, τ)). the inverse of the parametrization provides a local coordinate system on the world sheet in the sense of manifolds.
the equations of motion of a classical relativistic string derived in the lagrangian formalism from the nambu–goto action are
