a fourier series () is a sum that represents a periodic function as a sum of sine and cosine waves. the frequency of each wave in the sum, or harmonic, is an integer multiple of the periodic function's fundamental frequency. each harmonic's phase and amplitude can be determined using harmonic analysis. a fourier series may potentially contain an infinite number of harmonics. summing part of but not all the harmonics in a function's fourier series produces an approximation to that function. for example, using the first few harmonics of the fourier series for a square wave yields an approximation of a square wave.

		
		
almost any periodic function can be represented by a fourier series that converges. convergence of fourier series means that as more and more harmonics from the series are summed, each successive partial fourier series sum will better approximate the function, and will equal the function with a potentially infinite number of harmonics. the mathematical proofs for this may be collectively referred to as the fourier theorem (see § convergence).
fourier series can only represent functions that are periodic. however, non-periodic functions can be handled using an extension of the fourier series called the fourier transform which treats non-periodic functions as periodic with infinite period. this transform thus can generate frequency domain representations of non-periodic functions as well as periodic functions, allowing a waveform to be converted between its time domain representation and its frequency domain representation.
since fourier's time, many different approaches to defining and understanding the concept of fourier series have been discovered, all of which are consistent with one another, but each of which emphasizes different aspects of the topic. some of the more powerful and elegant approaches are based on mathematical ideas and tools that were not available in fourier's time. fourier originally defined the fourier series for real-valued functions of real arguments, and used the sine and cosine functions as the basis set for the decomposition. many other fourier-related transforms have since been defined, extending his initial idea to many applications and birthing an area of mathematics called fourier analysis.

              n
            
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{\scriptscriptstyle n}(x)}
   represents a synthesis of a periodic function 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)}
   by summing harmonically related sinusoids (called harmonics) whose coefficients are determined by harmonic analysis.


=== common forms ===
the fourier series can be represented in different forms. the amplitude-phase form, sine-cosine form, and exponential form are commonly used and are expressed here for a real-valued function 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)}
  . (see § complex-valued functions and § other common notations for alternative forms).
the number of terms summed, 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , is a potentially infinite integer. even so, the series might not converge or exactly equate to 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)}
   at all values of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (such as a single-point discontinuity) in the analysis interval. for the well-behaved functions typical of physical processes, equality is customarily assumed, and the dirichlet conditions provide sufficient conditions.
the integer index, 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , is also the number of cycles the 
  
    
      
        
          n

   harmonic makes in the function's period 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  . therefore:

          n

    {\displaystyle n^{\text{th}}}
   harmonic's wavelength is

              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {p}{n}}}
   and in units of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .

            th
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n^{\text{th}}}
   harmonic's frequency is

  it can be shown that the fourier series converges to 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)}
   at every point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   where 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is differentiable, and therefore:

when 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\pi }
  , the fourier series converges to 0, which is the half-sum of the left- and right-limit of s at 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\pi }
  . this is a particular instance of the dirichlet theorem for fourier series.
this example leads to a solution of the basel problem.


=== convergence ===

a proof that a fourier series is a valid representation of any periodic function (that satisfies the dirichlet conditions)  is overviewed in § fourier theorem proving convergence of fourier series.
in engineering applications, the fourier series is generally presumed to converge almost everywhere (the exceptions being at discrete discontinuities) since the functions encountered in engineering are better-behaved than the functions that mathematicians can provide as counter-examples to this presumption. in particular, if 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is continuous and the derivative of 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)}
   (which may not exist everywhere) is square integrable, then the fourier series of 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   converges absolutely and uniformly to 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)}
  . if a function is square-integrable on the interval 
  
    
      
        [
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        +
        p
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [x_{0},x_{0}+p]}
  , then the fourier series converges to the function at almost every point. it is possible to define fourier coefficients for more general functions or distributions, in such cases convergence in norm or weak convergence is usually of interest.

  in engineering, particularly when the variable 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   represents time, the coefficient sequence is called a frequency domain representation. square brackets are often used to emphasize that the domain of this function is a discrete set of frequencies.
another commonly used frequency domain representation uses the fourier series coefficients to modulate a dirac comb:

  
    
      
        s
        (
        f
        )

          ∑

            =
            −
            ∞

          )

    {\displaystyle s(f)\ \triangleq \ \sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }s[n]\cdot \delta \left(f-{\frac {n}{p}}\right),}
  where 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   represents a continuous frequency domain. when variable 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has units of seconds, 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   has units of hertz. the "teeth" of the comb are spaced at multiples (i.e. harmonics) of 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              1
              p
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{p}}}
  , which is called the fundamental frequency.

        (

the fourier series is named in honor of jean-baptiste joseph fourier (1768–1830), who made important contributions to the study of trigonometric series, after preliminary investigations by leonhard euler, jean le rond d'alembert, and daniel bernoulli. fourier introduced the series for the purpose of solving the heat equation in a metal plate, publishing his initial results in his 1807 mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides (treatise on the propagation of heat in solid bodies), and publishing his théorie analytique de la chaleur (analytical theory of heat) in 1822. the mémoire introduced fourier analysis, specifically fourier series. through fourier's research the fact was established that an arbitrary (at first, continuous and later generalized to any piecewise-smooth) function can be represented by a trigonometric series. the first announcement of this great discovery was made by fourier in 1807, before the french academy. early ideas of decomposing a periodic function into the sum of simple oscillating functions date back to the 3rd century bc, when ancient astronomers proposed an empiric model of planetary motions, based on deferents and epicycles.
the heat equation is a partial differential equation. prior to fourier's work, no solution to the heat equation was known in the general case, although particular solutions were known if the heat source behaved in a simple way, in particular, if the heat source was a sine or cosine wave. these simple solutions are now sometimes called eigensolutions. fourier's idea was to model a complicated heat source as a superposition (or linear combination) of simple sine and cosine waves, and to write the solution as a superposition of the corresponding eigensolutions. this superposition or linear combination is called the fourier series.
from a modern point of view, fourier's results are somewhat informal, due to the lack of a precise notion of function and integral in the early nineteenth century. later, peter gustav lejeune dirichlet and bernhard riemann expressed fourier's results with greater precision and formality.
although the original motivation was to solve the heat equation, it later became obvious that the same techniques could be applied to a wide array of mathematical and physical problems, and especially those involving linear differential equations with constant coefficients, for which the eigensolutions are sinusoids. the fourier series has many such applications in electrical engineering, vibration analysis, acoustics, optics, signal processing, image processing, quantum mechanics, econometrics, shell theory, etc.

in these few lines, which are close to the modern formalism used in fourier series, fourier revolutionized both mathematics and physics. although similar trigonometric series were previously used by euler, d'alembert, daniel bernoulli and gauss, fourier believed that such trigonometric series could represent any arbitrary function. in what sense that is actually true is a somewhat subtle issue and the attempts over many years to clarify this idea have led to important discoveries in the theories of convergence, function spaces, and harmonic analysis.
when fourier submitted a later competition essay in 1811, the committee (which included lagrange, laplace, malus and legendre, among others) concluded: ...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and...his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour.


=== fourier's motivation ===

the fourier series expansion of the sawtooth function (above) looks more complicated than the simple formula 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            
              x
              π
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)={\tfrac {x}{\pi }}}
  , so it is not immediately apparent why one would need the fourier series. while there are many applications, fourier's motivation was in solving the heat equation. for example, consider a metal plate in the shape of a square whose sides measure 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   meters, with coordinates 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        ∈
        [
        0
        ,
        π
        ]
        ×
        [
        0
        ,
        π
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y)\in [0,\pi ]\times [0,\pi ]}
  . if there is no heat source within the plate, and if three of the four sides are held at 0 degrees celsius, while the fourth side, given by 
  
    
      
        y
        =
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=\pi }
  , is maintained at the temperature gradient 
  
    
      
        t
        (
        x
        ,
        π
        )
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle t(x,\pi )=x}
   degrees celsius, for 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in 
  
    
      
        (
        0
        ,
        π
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (0,\pi )}
  , then one can show that the stationary heat distribution (or the heat distribution after a long period of time has elapsed) is given by

  
    
      
        t
        (
        x

    {\displaystyle t(x,y)=2\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{n+1}}{n}}\sin(nx){\sinh(ny) \over \sinh(n\pi )}.}
  here, sinh is the hyperbolic sine function. this solution of the heat equation is obtained by multiplying each term of eq.6 by 
  
    
      
        sinh
        ⁡
        (

        n
        π
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sinh(ny)/\sinh(n\pi )}
  . while our example function 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)}
   seems to have a needlessly complicated fourier series, the heat distribution 
  
    
      
        t
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle t(x,y)}
   is nontrivial. the function 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   cannot be written as a closed-form expression. this method of solving the heat problem was made possible by fourier's work.


=== complex fourier series animation ===

an example of the ability of the complex fourier series to trace any two dimensional closed figure is shown in the adjacent animation of the complex fourier series tracing the letter 'e' (for exponential). note that the animation uses the variable 't' to parameterize the letter 'e' in the complex plane, which is equivalent to using the parameter 'x' in this article's subsection on complex valued functions.
in the animation's back plane, the rotating vectors are aggregated in an order that alternates between a vector rotating in the positive (counter clockwise) direction and a vector rotating at the same frequency but in the negative (clockwise) direction, resulting in a single tracing arm with lots of zigzags. this perspective shows how the addition of each pair of rotating vectors (one rotating in the positive direction and one rotating in the negative direction) nudges the previous trace (shown as a light gray dotted line) closer to the shape of the letter 'e'.
in the animation's front plane, the rotating vectors are aggregated into two sets, the set of all the positive rotating vectors and the set of all the negative rotating vectors (the non-rotating component is evenly split between the two), resulting in two tracing arms rotating in opposite directions. the animation's small circle denotes the midpoint between the two arms and also the midpoint between the origin and the current tracing point denoted by '+'. this perspective shows how the complex fourier series is an extension (the addition of an arm) of the complex geometric series which has just one arm. it also shows how the two arms coordinate with each other. for example, as the tracing point is rotating in the positive direction, the negative direction arm stays parked. similarly, when the tracing point is rotating in the negative direction, the positive direction arm stays parked.
in between the animation's back and front planes are rotating trapezoids whose areas represent the values of the complex fourier series terms. this perspective shows the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the individual terms of the complex fourier series in relation to the series sum spatially converging to the letter 'e' in the back and front planes. the audio track's left and right channels correspond respectively to the real and imaginary components of the current tracing point '+' but increased in frequency by a factor of 3536 so that the animation's fundamental frequency (n=1) is a 220 hz tone (a220).


=== other applications ===
the discrete-time fourier transform is an example of a fourier series.
another application is to solve the basel problem by using parseval's theorem. the example generalizes and one may compute ζ(2n), for any positive integern.

  from this, various relationships are apparent, for example:

the transform of a real-valued function (sre + sro) is the even symmetric function sre + i sio.  conversely, an even-symmetric transform implies a real-valued time-domain.
the transform of an imaginary-valued function (i sie + i sio) is the odd symmetric function sro + i sie, and the converse is true.
the transform of an even-symmetric function (sre + i sio) is the real-valued function sre + sro, and the converse is true.
the transform of an odd-symmetric function (sro + i sie) is the imaginary-valued function i sie + i sio, and the converse is true.

        k
        ≥

    {\displaystyle k\geq 1}
   we have

        n
        →
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\to \infty }
  , it follows that 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        n

        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle |n|^{k}{\widehat {s}}[n]}
   tends to zero, which means that the fourier coefficients converge to zero faster than the kth power of n for any 
  
    
      
        k
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\geq 1}
  .


=== compact groups ===

one of the interesting properties of the fourier transform which we have mentioned, is that it carries convolutions to pointwise products. if that is the property which we seek to preserve, one can produce fourier series on any compact group. typical examples include those classical groups that are compact. this generalizes the fourier transform to all spaces of the form l2(g), where g is a compact group, in such a way that the fourier transform carries convolutions to pointwise products. the fourier series exists and converges in similar ways to the [−π,π] case.
an alternative extension to compact groups is the peter–weyl theorem, which proves results about representations of compact groups analogous to those about finite groups.


=== riemannian manifolds ===

if the domain is not a group, then there is no intrinsically defined convolution. however, if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a compact riemannian manifold, it has a laplace–beltrami operator. the laplace–beltrami operator is the differential operator that corresponds to laplace operator for the riemannian manifold 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . then, by analogy, one can consider heat equations on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . since fourier arrived at his basis by attempting to solve the heat equation, the natural generalization is to use the eigensolutions of the laplace–beltrami operator as a basis. this generalizes fourier series to spaces of the type 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}(x)}
  , where 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a riemannian manifold. the fourier series converges in ways similar to the 
  
    
      
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [-\pi ,\pi ]}
   case. a typical example is to take 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to be the sphere with the usual metric, in which case the fourier basis consists of spherical harmonics.


=== locally compact abelian groups ===

the generalization to compact groups discussed above does not generalize to noncompact, nonabelian groups. however, there is a straightforward generalization to locally compact abelian (lca) groups.
this generalizes the fourier transform to 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            1
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{1}(g)}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}(g)}
  , where 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is an lca group. if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is compact, one also obtains a fourier series, which converges similarly to the 
  
    
      
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [-\pi ,\pi ]}
   case, but if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is noncompact, one obtains instead a fourier integral. this generalization yields the usual fourier transform when the underlying locally compact abelian group is 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  .

=== fourier series on a square ===
we can also define the fourier series for functions of two variables 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   in the square 
  
    
      
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        ]
        ×
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [-\pi ,\pi ]\times [-\pi ,\pi ]}
  :

aside from being useful for solving partial differential equations such as the heat equation, one notable application of fourier series on the square is in image compression. in particular, the jpeg image compression standard uses the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, a discrete form of the fourier cosine transform, which uses only cosine as the basis function.
for two-dimensional arrays with a staggered appearance, half of the fourier series coefficients disappear, due to additional symmetry.


=== fourier series of bravais-lattice-periodic-function ===
a three-dimensional bravais lattice is defined as the set of vectors of the form:

where 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{i}}
   are integers and 
  
    
      
        
          
            a
          
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} _{i}}
   are three linearly independent vectors. assuming we have some function, 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {r} )}
  , such that it obeys the condition of periodicity for any bravais lattice vector 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
  , 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          r
        
        )
        =
        f
        (
        
          r
        
        +
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {r} )=f(\mathbf {r} +\mathbf {r} )}
  , we could make a fourier series of it. this kind of function can be, for example, the effective potential that one electron "feels" inside a periodic crystal. it is useful to make the fourier series of the potential when applying bloch's theorem. first, we may write any arbitrary position vector 
  
    
      
        
          r

            i
          
        
        ≜

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{i}\triangleq |\mathbf {a} _{i}|,}
   meaning that 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{i}}
   is defined to be the magnitude of 
  
    
      
        
          
            a
          
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} _{i}}
  , so

            a
          
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} _{i}}
  .
thus we can define a new function,

this new function, 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})}
  , is now a function of three-variables, each of which has periodicity 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{1}}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{2}}
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{3}}
   respectively:

this enables us to build up a set of fourier coefficients, each being indexed by three independent integers 
  
    
      
        
          m
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          m
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        
          m
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{1},m_{2},m_{3}}
  . in what follows, we use function notation to denote these coefficients, where previously we used subscripts. if we write a series for 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   on the interval 
  
    
      
        
          [
          
            0
            ,
            
              a
              
                1
              
            
          
          ]
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left[0,a_{1}\right]}
   for 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{1}}
  , we can define the following:

and then we can write:

further defining:

we can write 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   once again as:

finally applying the same for the third coordinate, we define:

we write 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   as:

re-arranging:

now, every reciprocal lattice vector can be written (but does not mean that it is the only way of writing) as 
  
    
      
        
          g
        
        =

        +

        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta _{ij}=1}

        =

          g

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
   in the original bravais lattice space, their scalar product is:

so it is clear that in our expansion of

which after some calculation and applying some non-trivial cross-product identities can be shown to be equal to:

(it may be advantageous for the sake of simplifying calculations, to work in such a cartesian coordinate system, in which it just so happens that

  the basic fourier series result for hilbert spaces can be written as

  
    
      
        f
        =
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            −
            ∞
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        ⟨
        f
        ,
        
          e
          
            n
          
        
        ⟩
        
        
          e
          
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }\langle f,e_{n}\rangle \,e_{n}.}
  
this corresponds exactly to the complex exponential formulation given above. the version with sines and cosines is also justified with the hilbert space interpretation. indeed, the sines and cosines form an orthogonal set:

(where δmn is the kronecker delta), and

furthermore, the sines and cosines are orthogonal to the constant function

== fourier theorem proving convergence of fourier series ==

these theorems, and informal variations of them that don't specify the convergence conditions, are sometimes referred to generically as fourier's theorem or the fourier theorem.the earlier eq.6  is a trigonometric polynomial of degree 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   that can be generally expressed as:


=== least squares property ===
parseval's theorem implies that:


=== convergence theorems ===

because of the least squares property, and because of the completeness of the fourier basis, we obtain an elementary convergence result.

we have already mentioned that if 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is continuously differentiable, then 
  
    
      
        (
        i
        ⋅
        n
        )
        s
        [
        n
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle (i\cdot n)s[n]}
   is the 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            th
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n^{\text{th}}}
   fourier coefficient of the derivative 
  
    
      
        
          s
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s'}
  . it follows, essentially from the cauchy–schwarz inequality, that 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{\infty }}
   is absolutely summable. the sum of this series is a continuous function, equal to 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  , since the fourier series converges in the mean to 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  :

this result can be proven easily if 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is further assumed to be 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c^{2}}
  , since in that case 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            2
          
        
        s
        [
        n
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle n^{2}s[n]}
   tends to zero as 
  
    
      
        n
        →
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\rightarrow \infty }
  . more generally, the fourier series is absolutely summable, thus converges uniformly to 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  , provided that 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   satisfies a hölder condition of order 
  
    
      
        α
        >
        1
        
          /
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha >1/2}
  . in the absolutely summable case, the inequality:

  
    
      
        
          sup
          
            x
          
        
        
          |
        
        s
        (
        x
        )
        −
        
          s
          
            
              
              
                n
              
            
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          |
        
        ≤
        
          ∑
          
            
              |
            
            n
            
              |
            
            >
            n
          
        
        
          |
        
        s
        [
        n
        ]
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sup _{x}|s(x)-s_{_{n}}(x)|\leq \sum _{|n|>n}|s[n]|}
  proves uniform convergence.
many other results concerning the convergence of fourier series are known, ranging from the moderately simple result that the series converges at 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   if 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is differentiable at 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , to lennart carleson's much more sophisticated result that the fourier series of an 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}}
   function actually converges almost everywhere.


=== divergence ===
since fourier series have such good convergence properties, many are often surprised by some of the negative results. for example, the fourier series of a continuous t-periodic function need not converge pointwise. the uniform boundedness principle yields a simple non-constructive proof of this fact.
in 1922, andrey kolmogorov published an article titled une série de fourier-lebesgue divergente presque partout in which he gave an example of a lebesgue-integrable function whose fourier series diverges almost everywhere. he later constructed an example of an integrable function whose fourier series diverges everywhere (katznelson 1976).
