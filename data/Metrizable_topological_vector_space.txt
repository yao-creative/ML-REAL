in functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a metrizable (resp. pseudometrizable) topological vector space (tvs) is a tvs whose topology is induced by a metric (resp. pseudometric). an lm-space is an inductive limit of a sequence of locally convex metrizable tvs.

== pseudometrics and values on topological groups ==
an additive topological group is an additive group endowed with a topology, called a group topology, under which addition and negation become continuous operators. 
a topology 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   on a real or complex vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is called a vector topology or a tvs topology if it makes the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication continuous (that is, if it makes 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   into a topological vector space). 
every topological vector space (tvs) 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is an additive commutative topological group but not all group topologies on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   are vector topologies. 
this is because despite it making addition and negation continuous, a group topology on a vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   may fail to make scalar multiplication continuous. 
for instance, the discrete topology on any non-trivial vector space makes addition and negation continuous but do not make scalar multiplication continuous.

    {\displaystyle d}
   on

   is the discrete topology, which makes

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,\tau )}
   is disconnected but every vector topology is connected. 
what fails is that scalar multiplication isn't continuous on 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        τ
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,\tau ).}
   
this example shows that a translation-invariant (pseudo)metric is not enough to guarantee a vector topology, which leads us to define paranorms and f-seminorms.

        n
        ∈
        
          
            n
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\in {\mathcal {n}},}
   there exists some 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in {\mathcal {n}}}
   such that 
  
    
      
        u
        +
        u
        ⊆
        n
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle u+u\subseteq n.}
  

all of the above conditions are consequently a necessary for a topology to form a vector topology. 
additive sequences of sets have the particularly nice property that they define non-negative continuous real-valued subadditive functions. 
these functions can then be used to prove many of the basic properties of topological vector spaces and also show that a hausdorff tvs with a countable basis of neighborhoods is metrizable. the following theorem is true more generally for commutative additive topological groups.

=== f-seminormed spaces ===
an f-seminormed space (resp. f-normed space) is a pair

    {\displaystyle x.}
   
if

    {\displaystyle (z,q)}
   are f-seminormed spaces then a map 
  
    
      
        f

        x
        →
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:x\to z}
   is called an isometric embedding if 
  
    
      
        q
        (
        f

    {\displaystyle q(f(x)-f(y))=p(x,y){\text{ for all }}x,y\in x.}
   
every isometric embedding of one f-seminormed space into another is a topological embedding, but the converse is not true in general.


=== examples of f-seminorms ===
every positive scalar multiple of an f-seminorm (resp. f-norm, seminorm) is again an f-seminorm (resp. f-norm, seminorm).
the sum of finitely many f-seminorms (resp. f-norms) is an f-seminorm (resp. f-norm).

    {\displaystyle x\mapsto \sup\{p(x),q(x)\}.}
   the same is true of the supremum of any non-empty finite family of f-seminorms on 
  
    
      
        x
        .

the restriction of an f-seminorm (resp. f-norm) to a vector subspace is an f-seminorm (resp. f-norm).
a non-negative real-valued function on 
  
    
      
        x

=== normability ===
a topological vector space is seminormable if and only if it has a convex bounded neighborhood of the origin. 
moreover, a tvs is normable if and only if it is hausdorff and seminormable. 
every metrizable tvs on a finite-dimensional vector space is a normable locally convex complete tvs, being tvs-isomorphic to euclidean space. consequently, any metrizable tvs that is not normable must be infinite dimensional. 
if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a metrizable locally convex tvs that possess a countable fundamental system of bounded sets, then 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is normable.if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a hausdorff locally convex space then the following are equivalent:

  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is normable.

  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has a (von neumann) bounded neighborhood of the origin.
the strong dual space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is normable.
and if this locally convex space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is also metrizable, then the following may be appended to this list:

the strong dual space of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is metrizable.
the strong dual space of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a fréchet–urysohn locally convex space.
in particular, if a metrizable locally convex space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (such as a fréchet space) is not normable then its strong dual space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   is not a fréchet–urysohn space and consequently, this complete hausdorff locally convex space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   is also neither metrizable nor normable.
another consequence of this is that if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a reflexive locally convex tvs whose strong dual 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   is metrizable then 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   is necessarily a reflexive fréchet space, 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a df-space, both 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   are necessarily complete hausdorff ultrabornological distinguished webbed spaces, and moreover, 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}^{\prime }}
   is normable if and only if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is normable if and only if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is fréchet–urysohn if and only if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is metrizable. in particular, such a space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is either a banach space or else it is not even a fréchet–urysohn space.


== metrically bounded sets and bounded sets ==

the smallest such

the converse is in general false but it is true for locally convex metrizable tvss.


== properties of pseudometrizable tvs ==

every metrizable locally convex tvs is a quasibarrelled space, bornological space, and a mackey space.
every complete pseudometrizable tvs is a barrelled space and a baire space (and hence non-meager).  however, there exist metrizable baire spaces that are not complete.
if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is bornological if and only if it is barreled, if and only if it is infrabarreled.
if

    {\displaystyle x}
   is a complete pseudometrizable tvs and 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}

          /
        
        m

the strong dual of a locally convex metrizable tvs is a webbed space.

a metrizable locally convex space is normable if and only if its strong dual space is a fréchet–urysohn locally convex space.
any product of complete metrizable tvss is a baire space.
a product of metrizable tvss is metrizable if and only if it all but at most countably many of these tvss have dimension 
  
    
      
        0.

a product of pseudometrizable tvss is pseudometrizable if and only if it all but at most countably many of these tvss have the trivial topology.
every complete pseudometrizable tvs is a barrelled space and a baire space (and thus non-meager).
the dimension of a complete metrizable tvs is either finite or uncountable.


=== completeness ===

every topological vector space (and more generally, a topological group) has a canonical uniform structure, induced by its topology, which allows the notions of completeness and uniform continuity to be applied to it. 
if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a metrizable tvs and 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
   is a metric that defines 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  's topology, then its possible that 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is complete as a tvs (i.e. relative to its uniformity) but the metric 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
   is not a complete metric (such metrics exist even for 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\mathbb {r} }
  ). 
thus, if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a tvs whose topology is induced by a pseudometric 
  
    
      
        d
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d,}
   then the notion of completeness of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (as a tvs) and the notion of completeness of the pseudometric space 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        d
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,d)}
   are not always equivalent. 
the next theorem gives a condition for when they are equivalent: 

if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a closed vector subspace of a complete pseudometrizable tvs 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   then the quotient space 
  
    
      
        x
        
          /
        
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle x/m}
   is complete.  
if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a complete vector subspace of a metrizable tvs 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and if the quotient space 
  
    
      
        x
        
          /
        
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle x/m}
   is complete then so is 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
    if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is not complete then 
  
    
      
        m
        :=
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle m:=x,}
   but not complete, vector subspace of

        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   of a tvs 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has the extension property if any continuous linear functional on 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   can be extended to a continuous linear functional on 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   
say that a tvs 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has the hahn-banach extension property (hbep) if every vector subspace of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has the extension property.the hahn-banach theorem guarantees that every hausdorff locally convex space has the hbep. 
for complete metrizable tvss there is a converse:

if a vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has uncountable dimension and if we endow it with the finest vector topology then this is a tvs with the hbep that is neither locally convex or metrizable.
