in applied mathematics, discretization is the process of transferring continuous functions, models, variables, and equations into discrete counterparts.  this process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. dichotomization is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a binary variable (creating a dichotomy for modeling purposes, as in binary classification).
discretization is also related to discrete mathematics, and is an important component of granular computing.  in this context, discretization may also refer to modification of variable or category granularity, as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.
whenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. the goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.
 the terms discretization  and quantization often have the same denotation but not always identical connotations. (specifically, the two terms share a semantic field.) the same is true of discretization error and quantization error.
mathematical methods relating to discretization include the euler–maruyama method and the zero-order hold.

=== approximations ===
exact discretization may sometimes be intractable due to the heavy matrix exponential and integral operations involved. it is much easier to calculate an approximate discrete model, based on that for small timesteps 
  
    
      
        
          e

        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{\mathbf {a} t}\approx \mathbf {i} +\mathbf {a} t}
  . the approximate solution then becomes:

        t
        )

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} [k+1]\approx (\mathbf {i} +\mathbf {a} t)\mathbf {x} [k]+t\mathbf {b} \mathbf {u} [k]}

== discretization of continuous features ==

in statistics and machine learning, discretization refers to the process of converting continuous features or variables to discretized or nominal features. this can be useful when creating probability mass functions.


== discretization of smooth functions ==

in generalized functions theory, discretization 
arises as a particular case of the convolution theorem 
on tempered distributions

  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
        {
        f
        ∗
        iii
        }
        =
        
          
            f
          
        
        {
        f
        }
        ⋅
        iii
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}\{f*\operatorname {iii} \}={\mathcal {f}}\{f\}\cdot \operatorname {iii} }
  

  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
        {
        α
        ⋅
        iii
        }
        =
        
          
            f
          
        
        {
        α
        }
        ∗
        iii
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}\{\alpha \cdot \operatorname {iii} \}={\mathcal {f}}\{\alpha \}*\operatorname {iii} }
  where 
  
    
      
        iii
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {iii} }
   is the dirac comb,

  
    
      
        ⋅
        iii
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cdot \operatorname {iii} }
   is discretization, 
  
    
      
        ∗
        iii

   is 
periodization, 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a rapidly decreasing tempered distribution 
(e.g. a dirac delta function 
  
    
      
        δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta }
   or any other 
compactly supported function), 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is a smooth, 
slowly growing
ordinary function (e.g. the function that is constantly 
  
    
      
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1}
  
or any other band-limited function)
and 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   is the (unitary, ordinary frequency) fourier transform.
functions 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   which are not smooth can be made smooth using a mollifier prior to discretization.
as an example, discretization of the function that is constantly 
  
    
      
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1}
   yields the sequence 
  
    
      
        [
        .
        .
        ,
        1
        ,
        1
        ,
        1
        ,
        .
        .
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [..,1,1,1,..]}
   which, interpreted as the coefficients of a linear combination of dirac delta functions, forms a dirac comb. if additionally truncation is applied, one obtains finite sequences, e.g. 
  
    
      
        [
        1
        ,
        1
        ,
        1
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [1,1,1,1]}
  . they are discrete in both, time and frequency.
