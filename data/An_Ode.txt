== background and release ==
we expressed our inner fears this time, and a lot of people talked about how we changed. but if you think about it, our inner fears are also part of seventeen, so it would be great if people can see this as an expansion of our genre instead. we will continue to try to show newer sides of ourselves, so listeners can continue to look forward to our music.
on august 5, the single, "hit" was released with a music video, prior to the rest of the album.an ode was released on september 16, 2019, with 5 physical album versions: "begin", "the poet", "hope", "truth" and "real". the album also includes a korean language version of their japanese single, "happy ending". the japanese single had been previously released on may 29. in contrast to their previous uplifting music style, an ode showcased a different side of seventeen, with a more darker concept.the album was supported by the ode to you tour, which kicked off on october 8 and was scheduled to have performances in several countries in europe, asia, and north america. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic, the remaining stops of the tour were cancelled in february 2020.
