poisson structures have been introduced by andré lichnerowicz in 1977. they were further studied in the classical paper of alan weinstein, where many basic structure theorems were first proved, and which exerted a huge influence on the development of poisson geometry — which today is deeply entangled with non-commutative geometry, integrable systems, topological field theories and representation theory, to name a few.
poisson structures are named after the french mathematician siméon denis poisson.


== definition ==
there are two main points of view to define poisson structures: it is customary and convenient to switch between them, and we shall do so below.


=== as bracket ===
let

    {\displaystyle {c^{\infty }}(m)}
   denote the real algebra of smooth real-valued functions on 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  , where the multiplication is defined pointwise. a poisson bracket (or poisson structure) on

    {\displaystyle \{f,g\}=-\{g,f\}}
  .

== symplectic leaves ==
a poisson manifold is naturally partitioned into regularly immersed symplectic manifolds of possibly different dimensions, called its symplectic leaves. these arise as the maximal integral submanifolds of the completely integrable singular foliation spanned by the hamiltonian vector fields.

        π

=== the regular case ===
for a regular poisson manifold, the image

        t
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\pi ^{\sharp }}(t^{*}m)\subset tm}
   is a regular distribution; it is easy to check that it is involutive, therefore, by frobenius theorem, 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   admits a partition into leaves. moreover, the poisson bivector restricts nicely to each leaf, which become therefore symplectic manifolds. 


=== the non-regular case ===
for a non-regular poisson manifold the situation is more complicated, since the distribution

=== weinstein splitting theorem ===

=== trivial poisson structures ===
every manifold 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   carries the trivial poisson structure 
  
    
      
        {
        f
        ,
        g
        }
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f,g\}=0}
  , equivalently described by the bivector 
  
    
      
        π
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi =0}
  . every point of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is therefore a zero-dimensional symplectic leaf.


=== nondegenerate poisson structures ===
a bivector field 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   is called nondegenerate if 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            ♯
          
        
        :
        
          t
          
            ∗
          
        
        m
        →
        t
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi ^{\sharp }:t^{*}m\to tm}
   is a vector bundle isomorphism. nondegenerate poisson bivector fields are actually the same thing as symplectic manifolds 
  
    
      
        (
        m
        ,
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (m,\omega )}
  .
indeed, there is a bijective correspondence between nondegenerate bivector fields 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   and nondegenerate 2-forms 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  , given bywhere 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   is encoded by 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            ♭
          
        
        :
        t
        m
        →
        
          t
          
            ∗
          
        
        m
        ,
        
        v
        ↦
        ω
        (
        v
        ,
        ⋅
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega ^{\flat }:tm\to t^{*}m,\quad v\mapsto \omega (v,\cdot )}
  . furthermore, 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   is poisson precisely if and only if 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   is closed; in such case, the bracket becomes the canonical poisson bracket from hamiltonian mechanics:non-degenerate poisson structures have only one symplectic leaf, namely 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   itself, and their poisson algebra 
  
    
      
        (
        
          
            
              c
            
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        (
        m
        )
        ,
        {
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        }
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {c}}^{\infty }(m),\{\cdot ,\cdot \})}
   become a poisson ring.


=== linear poisson structures ===
a poisson structure 
  
    
      
        {
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\cdot ,\cdot \}}
   on a vector space 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is called linear when the bracket of two linear functions is still linear. the class of vector spaces with linear poisson structures coincides actually with that of (dual of) lie algebras.
indeed, the dual 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              g
            
          
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}^{*}}
   of any finite-dimensional lie algebra 
  
    
      
        (
        
          
            g

        [

        ⋅
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle ({\mathfrak {g}},[\cdot ,\cdot ])}
   carries a linear poisson bracket, known in the literature under the names of lie-poisson, kirillov-poisson or kks (kostant-kirillov-souriau) structure:

=== symplectic realisations ===
a symplectic realisation on a poisson manifold m consists of a symplectic manifold 
  
    
      
        (
        p
        ,
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (p,\omega )}
   together with a poisson map 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        :
        (
        p
        ,
        ω
        )
        →
        (
        m

        π
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :(p,\omega )\to (m,\pi )}
   which is a surjective submersion. roughly speaking, the role of a symplectic realisation is to "desingularise" a complicated (degenerate) poisson manifold by passing to a bigger, but easier (non-degenerate), one. 
note that some authors define symplectic realisations without this last condition (so that, for instance, the inclusion of a symplectic leaf in a symplectic manifold is an example) and call full a symplectic realisation where 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   is a surjective submersion. examples of (full) symplectic realisations include the following:

   is automatically a symplectic groupoid.accordingly, the integrability problem for a poisson manifold consists in finding a symplectic groupoid which integrates its cotangent algebroid; when this happens, we say that the poisson structure is integrable.
while any poisson manifold admits a local integration (i.e. a symplectic groupoid where the multiplication is defined only locally), there are general topological obstructions to its integrability, coming from the integrability theory for lie algebroids. using such obstructions, one can show that a poisson manifold is integrable if and only if it admits a complete symplectic realisation.

  , for 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        
          
            
              c

this definition is very natural and satisfies several good properties, e.g. the transverse intersection of two poisson submanifolds is again a poisson submanifold. however, it has also a few problems:

poisson submanifolds are rare: for instance, the only poisson submanifolds of a symplectic manifold are the open sets;
the definition does not behave functorially: if 
  
    
      
        φ
        :
        (
        m
        ,
        
          π
          
            m
          
        
        )
        →
        (
        n
        ,
        
          π
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :(m,\pi _{m})\to (n,\pi _{n})}
   is a poisson map transverse to a poisson submanifold 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
   of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , the submanifold 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        q
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi ^{-1}(q)}
   of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is not necessarily poisson.in order to overcome these problems, one often uses the notion of a poisson transversal (originally called cosymplectic submanifold). this can be defined as a submanifold 
  
    
      
        x
        ⊆
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\subseteq m}
   which is transverse to every symplectic leaf 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   and such that the intersection 
  
    
      
        x
        ∩
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\cap s}
   is a symplectic submanifold of 
  
    
      
        (
        s
        ,
        
          ω
          
            s
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (s,\omega _{s})}
  . it follows that any poisson transversal 
  
    
      
        x
        ⊆
        (
        m
        ,
        π
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\subseteq (m,\pi )}
   inherits a canonical poisson structure 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{x}}
   from 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  . in the case of a nondegenerate poisson manifold 
  
    
      
        (
        m
        ,
        π
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (m,\pi )}
   (whose only symplectic leaf is 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   itself), poisson transversals are the same thing as symplectic submanifolds.
more general classes of submanifolds play an important role in poisson geometry, including lie-dirac submanifolds, poisson-dirac submanifolds, coisotropic submanifolds and pre-poisson submanifolds.
