benoit mandelbrot has stated that "a fractal is by definition a set for which the hausdorff-besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension."
presented here is a list of fractals ordered by increasing hausdorff dimension, with the purpose of visualizing what it means for a fractal to have a low or a high dimension.
