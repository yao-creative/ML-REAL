in mathematics and theoretical physics (especially twistor theory), twistor space is the complex vector space of solutions of the twistor equation 
  
    
      
        
          ∇
          
            
              a
              ′
            
          
          
            (
            a
          
        
        
          ω
          
            
              
              

              
            
          
          
            b
            )
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nabla _{a'}^{(a}\omega _{^{}}^{b)}=0}
  . it was described in the 1960s by roger penrose and malcolm maccallum. according to andrew hodges, twistor space is useful for conceptualizing the way photons travel through space, using four complex numbers. he also posits that twistor space may aid in understanding the asymmetry of the weak nuclear force.


== informal motivation ==
in the (translated) words of jacques hadamard: "the shortest path between two truths in the real domain passes through the complex domain."  therefore when studying four-dimensional space 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{4}}
   it might be valuable to identify it with 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
          
          
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} ^{2}.}
   however, since there is no canonical way of doing so, instead all isomorphisms respecting orientation and metric between the two are considered. it turns out that complex projective 3-space 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
            p
          
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {cp} ^{3}}
   parametrizes such isomorphisms together with complex coordinates. thus one complex coordinate describes the identification and the other two describe a point in 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{4}}
  . it turns out that vector bundles with self-dual connections on 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{4}}
  (instantons) correspond bijectively to holomorphic bundles on complex projective 3-space 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
            p

points in minkowski space are related to subspaces of twistor space through the incidence relation

  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            a

          x

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega ^{a}=ix^{aa'}\pi _{a'}.}
  this incidence relation is preserved under an overall re-scaling of the twistor, so usually one works in projective twistor space, denoted 
  
    
      
        
          p
          t

   it is related to a line in  projective twistor space where we can see the incidence relation as giving the linear embedding of a 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
            p

the geometric relation between projective twistor space and complexified compactified minkowski space is the same as the relation between lines and two-planes in twistor space; more precisely, twistor space is
