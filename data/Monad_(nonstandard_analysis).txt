in nonstandard analysis, a monad (also called  halo)   is the set of points infinitesimally close to a given point.
given a hyperreal number x in r∗, the monad of x is the set

  
    
      
        
          monad
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        {
        y
        ∈
        
          
            r
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        ∣
        x
        −
        y
        
           is infinitesimal
        
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{monad}}(x)=\{y\in \mathbb {r} ^{*}\mid x-y{\text{ is infinitesimal}}\}.}
  if x is finite (limited), the unique real number in the monad of x is called the standard part of x.
