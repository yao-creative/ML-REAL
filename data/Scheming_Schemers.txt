== production notes ==
scheming schemers is a remake of vagabond loafers, which in itself was a remake of a plumbing we will go with former stooge curly howard (who had died in january 1952); additional pie fight footage was borrowed from half-wits holiday. this makes this the only three stooges short to use footage from three previous short subjects. scheming schemers was one of four shorts filmed in the wake of shemp howard's death using earlier footage and a stand-in. this film is also the last to contain new footage with long-time stooges supporting actor kenneth macdonald.


== "fake shemp" ==

as shemp howard had already died, for his last four films (rumpus in the harem, hot stuff, scheming schemers and commotion on the ocean), columbia utilized supporting actor joe palma to be shemp's double. even though the last four shorts were remakes of earlier shemp efforts, palma's services were needed to film new scenes in order to link existing stock footage.for scheming schemers, palma appears for the shot of "shemp" with his back to the camera, honking the horn of the stooges' jeep. palma then gathers several pipes, obstructing his face. palma's one line of dialogue — "hold yer horses, will ya?" — is shemp's voice borrowed from the soundtrack of 1949's the ghost talks. this new footage was shot on january 16, 1956, only six weeks after shemp's death.
