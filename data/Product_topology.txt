in topology and related areas of mathematics, a product space is the cartesian product of a family of topological spaces equipped with a natural topology called the product topology.  this topology differs from another, perhaps more obvious, topology called the box topology, which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces.  however, the product topology is "correct" in that it makes the product space a categorical product of its factors, whereas the box topology is too fine; in that sense the product topology is the natural topology on the cartesian product.

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is defined to be the coarsest topology (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            i

        :=
        
          ∏

    {\displaystyle x:=\prod _{i\in i}x_{i}}
   endowed with the product topology is called the product space. 
the product topology is also called the topology of pointwise convergence because of the following fact: a sequence (or net) in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   converges if and only if all its projections to the spaces 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}}
   converge. in particular, if one considers the space 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          
            r
          
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\mathbb {r} ^{i}}
   of all real valued functions on 
  
    
      
        i
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle i,}
   convergence in the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions. 
the open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets of the form 
  
    
      
        
          ∏
          
            i
            ∈
            i
          
        
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \prod _{i\in i}u_{i},}
   where each 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            i

   is open in 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        ≠
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{i}\neq x_{i}}
   for only finitely many 
  
    
      
        i
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle i.}
   in particular, for a finite product (in particular, for the product of two topological spaces), the set of all cartesian products between one basis element from each

several additional examples are given in the article on the initial topology.

    {\displaystyle y}
   is a topological space, and for every

   the following diagram commutes.

this shows that the product space is a product in the category of topological spaces. it follows from the above universal property that a map 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        y
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:y\to x}
   is continuous if and only if 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            i

   in many cases it is easier to check that the component functions

        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\to y}
   is continuous is usually more difficult; one tries to use the fact that the

tychonoff's theorem, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice, states any product of compact spaces is a compact space. a specialization of tychonoff's theorem that requires only the ultrafilter lemma (and not the full strength of the axiom of choice) states that any product of compact hausdorff spaces is a compact space.

== axiom of choice ==
one of many ways to express the axiom of choice is to say that it is equivalent to the statement that the cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. the proof that this is equivalent to the statement of the axiom in terms of choice functions is immediate: one needs only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product. conversely, a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one element from each component.
the axiom of choice occurs again in the study of (topological) product spaces; for example, tychonoff's theorem on compact sets is a more complex and subtle example of a statement that requires the axiom of choice and is equivalent to it in its most general formulation, and shows why the product topology may be considered the more useful topology to put on a cartesian product.
