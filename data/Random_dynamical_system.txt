in the mathematical field of dynamical systems, a random dynamical system is a dynamical system in which the equations of motion have an element of randomness to them. random dynamical systems are characterized by a state space s, a set of maps 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   from s into itself that can be thought of as the set of all possible equations of motion, and a probability distribution q on the set 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   that represents the random choice of map. motion in a random dynamical system can be informally thought of as a state 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in s}
   evolving according to a succession of maps randomly chosen according to the distribution q.an example of a random dynamical system is a stochastic differential equation; in this case the distribution q is typically determined by noise terms. it consists of a base flow, the "noise", and a cocycle dynamical system on the "physical" phase space. another example is discrete state random dynamical system; some elementary contradistinctions between markov chain and random dynamical system descriptions of a stochastic dynamics are discussed.

reversely, can, and how, a given mc be represented by the compositions of i.i.d. random transformations? yes, it can, but not unique. the proof for existence is similar with birkhoff–von neumann theorem for doubly stochastic matrix.
here is an example that illustrates the existence and non-uniqueness.

    {\displaystyle \vartheta _{s}\circ \vartheta _{t}=\vartheta _{s+t}}
  .that is, 
  
    
      
        
          ϑ
          
            s

        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}

        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  ; in these cases, the maps

            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \vartheta _{s}}
   would only form a commutative monoid instead of a group.
while true in most applications, it is not usually part of the formal definition of a random dynamical system to require that the measure-preserving dynamical system 
  
    
      
        (
        ω
        ,

          p
        
        ,
        ϑ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\omega ,{\mathcal {f}},\mathbb {p} ,\vartheta )}
   is ergodic.

  , the base flow 
  
    
      
        
          ϑ
          
            s
          
        
        :
        ω
        →
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \vartheta _{s}:\omega \to \omega }
   would be given by

  
    
      
        w
        (
        t
        ,
        
          ϑ
          
            s

        )

        w

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle w(t,\vartheta _{s}(\omega ))=w(t+s,\omega )-w(s,\omega )}
  .this can be read as saying that 
  
    
      
        
          ϑ
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \vartheta _{s}}
   "starts the noise at time 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   instead of time 0". thus, the cocycle property can be read as saying that evolving the initial condition 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}}
   with some noise 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   for 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   seconds and then through 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   seconds with the same noise (as started from the 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   seconds mark) gives the same result as evolving 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}}
   through 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        +
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t+s)}
   seconds with that same noise.


== attractors for random dynamical systems ==
the notion of an attractor for a random dynamical system is not as straightforward to define as in the deterministic case. for technical reasons, it is necessary to "rewind time", as in the definition of a pullback attractor. moreover, the attractor is dependent upon the realisation 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   of the noise.
