in mathematics, a finitely generated algebra (also called an algebra of finite type) is a commutative associative algebra a over a field k where there exists a finite set of elements a1,...,an of a such that every element of a can be expressed as a polynomial in a1,...,an, with coefficients in k.
equivalently, there exist elements

  .if it is necessary to emphasize the field k then the algebra is said to be finitely generated over k . algebras that are not finitely generated are called infinitely generated.


== examples ==
the polynomial algebra k[x1,...,xn] is finitely generated. the polynomial algebra in infinitely countably many generators is infinitely generated.
the field e = k(t) of rational functions in one variable over an infinite field k is not a finitely generated algebra over k. on the other hand, e is generated over k by a single element, t, as a field.
if e/f is a finite field extension then it follows from the definitions that e is a finitely generated algebra over f.
conversely, if e /f is a field extension and e is a finitely generated algebra over f then the field extension is finite. this is called zariski's lemma. see also integral extension.
if g is a finitely generated group then the group ring kg is a finitely generated algebra over k.


== properties ==
a homomorphic image of a finitely generated algebra is itself finitely generated. however,  a similar property for subalgebras does not hold in general.
hilbert's basis theorem: if a is a finitely generated commutative algebra over a noetherian ring then every ideal of a is finitely generated, or equivalently, a is a noetherian ring.


== relation with affine varieties ==
finitely generated reduced commutative algebras are basic objects of consideration in modern algebraic geometry, where they correspond to affine algebraic varieties; for this reason, these algebras are also referred to as (commutative) affine algebras. more precisely, given an affine algebraic set
