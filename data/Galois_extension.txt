in mathematics, a galois extension is an algebraic field extension e/f that is normal and separable; or equivalently, e/f is algebraic, and the field fixed by the automorphism group aut(e/f) is precisely the base field f. the significance of being a galois extension is that the extension has a galois group and obeys the fundamental theorem of galois theory.a result of emil artin allows one to construct galois extensions as follows: if e is a given field, and g is a finite group of automorphisms of e with fixed field f, then e/f is a galois extension.


== characterization of galois extensions ==
an important theorem of emil artin states that for a finite extension 
  
    
      
        e
        
          /
        
        f
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle e/f,}
   each of the following statements is equivalent to the statement that 
  
    
      
        e
        
          /
        
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle e/f}
   is galois:

  
    
      
        e
        
          /
        
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle e/f}
   is a normal extension and a separable extension.

  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is a splitting field of a separable polynomial with coefficients in 
  
    
      
        f
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f.}
  

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
        aut
        ⁡
        (
        e
        
          /
        
        f
        )
        
          |
        
        =
        [
        e
        :
        f
        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\!\operatorname {aut} (e/f)|=[e:f],}
   that is, the number of automorphisms equals the degree of the extension.other equivalent statements are:

every irreducible polynomial in 
  
    
      
        f
        [
        x
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle f[x]}
   with at least one root in 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   splits over 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   and is separable.

          |
        
        ≥
        [
        e
        :
        f
        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\!\operatorname {aut} (e/f)|\geq [e:f],}
   that is, the number of automorphisms is at least the degree of the extension.

  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is the fixed field of a subgroup of 
  
    
      
        aut

        (
        e
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {aut} (e).}

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {aut} (e/f).}
  
there is a one-to-one correspondence between subfields of 
  
    
      
        e
        
          /
        
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle e/f}
   and subgroups of 
  
    
      
        aut
        ⁡
        (
        e

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {aut} (e/f).}
  


== examples ==
there are two basic ways to construct examples of galois extensions.

take any field 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
  , any subgroup of 
  
    
      
        aut
        ⁡
        (
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {aut} (e)}
  , and let 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   be the fixed field.
take any field 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  , any separable polynomial in 
  
    
      
        f
        [
        x
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle f[x]}
  , and let 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   be its splitting field.adjoining to the rational number field the square root of 2 gives a galois extension, while adjoining the cubic root of 2 gives a non-galois extension. both these extensions are separable, because they have characteristic zero. the first of them is the splitting field of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        −
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{2}-2}
  ; the second has normal closure that includes the complex  cubic roots of unity, and so is not a splitting field. in fact, it has no automorphism other than the identity, because it is contained in the real numbers and 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
        −
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{3}-2}
   has just one real root. for more detailed examples, see the page on the fundamental theorem of galois theory.
an algebraic closure 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              k
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {k}}}
   of an arbitrary field 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is galois over 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is a perfect field.
