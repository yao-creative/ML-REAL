in physics, liouville field theory (or simply liouville theory) is a two-dimensional conformal field theory whose classical equation of motion is a generalization of liouville's equation.
liouville theory is defined for all complex values of the central charge 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   of its virasoro symmetry algebra, but it is unitary only if 

  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        (
        1
        ,
        +
        ∞
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in (1,+\infty )}
  ,and its classical limit is 

  
    
      
        c
        →
        +
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\to +\infty }
  .although it is an interacting theory with a continuous spectrum, liouville theory has been solved. in particular, its three-point function on the sphere has been determined analytically. 


== introduction ==
liouville theory describes the dynamics of a field 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   called the liouville field, which is defined on a two-dimensional space. this field is not a free field due to the presence of an exponential potential

  
    
      
        v
        (
        ϕ
        )
        =
        
          e
          
            2
            b
            ϕ
          
        
         
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle v(\phi )=e^{2b\phi }\ ,}
  where the parameter 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   is called the coupling constant. in a free field theory, the energy eigenvectors 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            2
            α
            ϕ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{2\alpha \phi }}
   are linearly independent, and the momentum 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is conserved in interactions. in liouville theory, momentum is not conserved. 

 
moreover, the potential reflects the energy eigenvectors before they reach 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        =
        +
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi =+\infty }
  , and two eigenvectors are linearly dependent if their momenta are related by the reflection

  
    
      
        α
        →
        q
        −
        α
         
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha \to q-\alpha \ ,}
  where the background charge is 

  
    
      
        q
        =
        b
        +
        
          
            1
            b
          
        
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle q=b+{\frac {1}{b}}\ .}
  while the exponential potential breaks momentum conservation, it does not break conformal symmetry, and liouville theory is a conformal field theory with the central charge 

  
    
      
        c
        =
        1
        +

          q
          
            2
          
        
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c=1+6q^{2}\ .}
  under conformal transformations, an energy eigenvector with momentum 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   transforms as a primary field with the conformal dimension 
  
    
      
        δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta }
   by

  
    
      
        δ
        =
        α
        (
        q
        −
        α
        )
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta =\alpha (q-\alpha )\ .}
  the central charge and conformal dimensions are invariant under the duality

  
    
      
        b
        →
        
          
            1
            b
          
        
         
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\to {\frac {1}{b}}\ ,}
  the correlation functions of liouville theory are covariant under this duality, and under reflections of the momenta. these quantum symmetries of liouville theory are however not manifest in the lagrangian formulation, in particular the exponential potential is not invariant under the duality.

=== fields and reflection relation ===
in liouville theory, primary fields are usually parametrized by their momentum rather than their conformal dimension, and denoted

  . technically, this is equivalent to the modular invariance of the torus one-point function. due to remarkable identities of conformal blocks and structure constants, this modular invariance property can be deduced from crossing symmetry of the sphere four-point function.


=== uniqueness of liouville theory ===
using the conformal bootstrap approach, liouville theory can be shown to be the unique conformal field theory such that
the spectrum is a continuum, with no multiplicities higher than one,
the correlation functions depend analytically on 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   and the momenta,
degenerate fields exist.

   and obey the reflection relation. nevertheless, the path integral representation can be used for computing the residues of correlation functions at some of their poles as dotsenko-fateev integrals in the coulomb gas formalism, and this is how the dozz formula was first guessed in the 1990s. it is only in the 2010s that a rigorous probabilistic construction of the path integral was found, which led to a proof of the dozz formula and the conformal bootstrap.

=== some limits of liouville theory ===
when the central charge and conformal dimensions are sent to the relevant discrete values, correlation functions of liouville theory reduce to correlation functions of diagonal (a-series) virasoro minimal models.on the other hand, when the central charge is sent to one while conformal dimensions stay continuous, liouville theory tends to runkel-watts theory, a nontrivial conformal field theory (cft) with a continuous spectrum whose three-point function is not analytic as a function of the momenta. generalizations of runkel-watts theory are obtained from liouville theory by taking limits of the type

== applications ==


=== liouville gravity ===
in two dimensions, the einstein equations reduce to liouville's equation, so liouville theory provides a quantum theory of gravity that is called liouville gravity. it should not be confused with the cghs model or jackiw–teitelboim gravity.


=== string theory ===

liouville theory appears in the context of string theory when trying to formulate a non-critical version of the theory in the path integral formulation. also in the string theory context, if coupled to a free bosonic field, liouville field theory can be thought of as the theory describing string excitations in a two-dimensional space(time).


=== random energy models ===
there is an exact mapping between liouville theory with 
  
    
      
        c
        ≥
        25
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\geq 25}
  , and certain log-correlated random energy models. these models describe a thermal particle in a random potential that is logarithmically correlated. in two dimensions, such potential coincides with the gaussian free field. in that case, certain correlation functions between primary fields in the liouville theory are mapped to correlation functions of the gibbs measure of the particle. this has applications to extreme value statistics of the two-dimensional gaussian free field, and allows to predict certain universal properties of the log-correlated random energy models (in two dimensions and beyond).


=== other applications ===
liouville theory is related to other subjects in physics and mathematics, such as three-dimensional general relativity in negatively curved spaces, the uniformization problem of riemann surfaces, and other problems in conformal mapping. it is also related to instanton partition functions in a certain four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories by the agt correspondence.


== naming confusion for c<=1 ==
liouville theory with 
  
    
      
        c
        ≤
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\leq 1}
   first appeared as a model of time-dependent string theory under the name timelike liouville theory.
it has also been called a generalized minimal model. it was first called liouville theory when it was found to actually exist, and to be spacelike rather than timelike. as of 2022, not one of these three names is universally accepted.
