in mathematics, the equivariant algebraic k-theory is an algebraic k-theory associated to the category 
  
    
      
        
          coh
          
            g
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {coh} ^{g}(x)}
   of equivariant coherent sheaves on an algebraic scheme x with action of a linear algebraic group g,  via quillen's q-construction; thus, by definition,

  
    
      
        
          k
          
            i
          
          
            g
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          π
          
            i
          
        
        (
        
          b
          
            +
          
        
        
          coh
          
            g
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        x
        )
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle k_{i}^{g}(x)=\pi _{i}(b^{+}\operatorname {coh} ^{g}(x)).}
  in particular, 
  
    
      
        
          k
          
            0
          
          
            g
          
        
        (
        c
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k_{0}^{g}(c)}
   is the grothendieck group of 
  
    
      
        
          coh
          
            g
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {coh} ^{g}(x)}
  . the theory was developed by r. w. thomason in 1980s. specifically, he proved equivariant analogs of fundamental theorems such as the localization theorem.
equivalently, 
  
    
      
        
          k
          
            i
          
          
            g
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k_{i}^{g}(x)}
   may be defined as the 
  
    
      
        
          k
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle k_{i}}
   of the category of coherent sheaves on the quotient stack 
  
    
      
        [
        x
        
          /
        
        g
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [x/g]}
  . (hence, the equivariant k-theory is a specific case of the k-theory of a stack.)
a version of the lefschetz fixed-point theorem holds in the setting of equivariant (algebraic) k-theory.


== fundamental theorems ==
let x be an equivariant algebraic scheme.


== examples ==
one of the fundamental examples of equivariant k-theory groups are the equivariant k-groups of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -equivariant coherent sheaves on a points, so 
  
    
      
        
          k
          
            i
          
          
            g
          
        
        (
        ∗
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k_{i}^{g}(*)}
  . since 
  
    
      
        
          
            coh
          
          
            g
          
        
        (
        ∗
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{coh}}^{g}(*)}
   is equivalent to the category 
  
    
      
        
          rep
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{rep}}(g)}
   of finite-dimensional representations of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  . then, the grothendieck group of 
  
    
      
        
          rep
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{rep}}(g)}
  , denoted 
  
    
      
        r
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle r(g)}
   is 
  
    
      
        
          k
          
            0
          
          
            g
          
        
        (
        ∗
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k_{0}^{g}(*)}
  .
