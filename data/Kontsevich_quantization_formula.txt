in mathematics, the kontsevich quantization formula describes how to construct a generalized ★-product operator algebra from a given arbitrary finite-dimensional poisson manifold. this operator algebra amounts to the deformation quantization of the corresponding poisson algebra. it is due to maxim kontsevich.


== deformation quantization of a poisson algebra ==
given a poisson algebra (a, {⋅, ⋅}), a deformation quantization is an associative unital product ★ on the algebra of formal power series in ħ, a[[ħ]], subject to the following two axioms,

== kontsevich graphs ==
a kontsevich graph is a simple directed graph without loops on 2 external vertices, labeled f and g; and n internal vertices, labeled π. from each internal vertex originate two edges. all (equivalence classes of) graphs with n internal vertices are accumulated in the set gn(2).
an example on two internal vertices is the following graph,


=== associated bidifferential operator ===
associated to each graph γ, there is a bidifferential operator bγ( f, g) defined as follows.  for each edge there is a partial derivative on the symbol of the target vertex. it is contracted with the corresponding index from the source symbol. the term for the graph γ is the product of all its symbols together with their partial derivatives. here f and g stand for smooth functions on the manifold, and π is the poisson bivector of the poisson manifold.
the term for the example graph is

=== associated weight ===
for adding up these bidifferential operators there are the weights wγ of the graph γ. first of all, to each graph there is a multiplicity m(γ) which counts how many equivalent configurations there are for one graph. the rule is that the sum of the multiplicities for all graphs with n internal vertices is (n(n + 1))n. the sample graph above has the multiplicity m(γ) = 8. for this, it is helpful to enumerate the internal vertices from 1 to n.
in order to compute the weight we have to integrate products of the angle in the upper half-plane, h, as follows. the upper half-plane is h ⊂ ℂ, endowed with a metric

  
    
      
        d
