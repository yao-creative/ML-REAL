in mathematics, the wiener process is a real valued continuous-time stochastic process named in honor of american mathematician norbert wiener for his investigations on the mathematical properties of the one-dimensional brownian motion. it is often also called brownian motion due to its historical connection with the physical process of the same name originally observed by scottish botanist robert brown. it is one of the best known lévy processes (càdlàg stochastic processes with stationary independent increments) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, economics, quantitative finance, evolutionary biology, and physics.
the wiener process plays an important role in both pure and applied mathematics. in pure mathematics, the wiener process gave rise to the study of continuous time martingales. it is a key process in terms of which more complicated stochastic processes can be described. as such, it plays a vital role in stochastic calculus, diffusion processes and even potential theory. it is the driving process of schramm–loewner evolution. in applied mathematics, the wiener process is used to represent the integral of a white noise gaussian process, and so is useful as a model of noise in electronics engineering (see brownian noise), instrument errors in filtering theory and disturbances in control theory.
the wiener process has applications throughout the mathematical sciences. in physics it is used to study brownian motion, the diffusion of minute particles suspended in fluid, and other types of diffusion via the fokker–planck and langevin equations. it also forms the basis for the rigorous path integral formulation of quantum mechanics (by the feynman–kac formula, a solution to the schrödinger equation can be represented in terms of the wiener process) and the study of eternal inflation in physical cosmology. it is also prominent in the mathematical theory of finance, in particular the black–scholes option pricing model.

    {\displaystyle t}
  .that the process has independent increments means that if 0 ≤ s1 < t1 ≤ s2 < t2 then wt1 − ws1 and wt2 − ws2 are independent random variables, and the similar condition holds for n increments.
an alternative characterisation of the wiener process is the so-called lévy characterisation that says that the wiener process is an almost surely continuous martingale with w0 = 0 and quadratic variation [wt, wt] = t (which means that wt2 − t is also a martingale).
a third characterisation is that the wiener process has a spectral representation as a sine series whose coefficients are independent n(0, 1) random variables.  this representation can be obtained using the karhunen–loève theorem.
another characterisation of a wiener process is the definite integral (from time zero to time t) of a zero mean, unit variance, delta correlated ("white") gaussian process.the wiener process can be constructed as the scaling limit of a random walk, or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. this is known as donsker's theorem. like the random walk, the wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed neighborhood of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. unlike the random walk, it is scale invariant, meaning that

    {\displaystyle \alpha ^{-1}w_{\alpha ^{2}t}}
  is a wiener process for any nonzero constant α. the wiener measure is the probability law on the space of continuous functions g, with g(0) = 0, induced by the wiener process. an integral based on wiener measure may be called a wiener integral.

=== some properties of sample paths ===
the set of all functions w with these properties is of full wiener measure. that is, a path (sample function) of the wiener process has all these properties almost surely.


==== qualitative properties ====
for every ε > 0, the function w takes both (strictly) positive and (strictly) negative values on (0, ε).
the function w is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere (like the weierstrass function).
points of local maximum of the function w are a dense countable set; the maximum values are pairwise different; each local maximum is sharp in the following sense: if w has a local maximum at t then
  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            s
            →
            t
          
        
        
          
            
              
                |
              
              w
              (
              s
              )
              −
              w
              (
              t
              )
              
                |
              
            
            
              
                |
              
              s
              −
              t
              
                |
              
            
          
        
        →
        ∞
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{s\to t}{\frac {|w(s)-w(t)|}{|s-t|}}\to \infty .}
  
the same holds for local minima.the function w has no points of local increase, that is, no t > 0 satisfies the following for some ε in (0, t): first, w(s) ≤ w(t) for all s in (t − ε, t), and second, w(s) ≥ w(t) for all s in (t, t + ε). (local increase is a weaker condition than that w is increasing on (t − ε, t + ε).) the same holds for local decrease.
the function w is of unbounded variation on every interval.
the quadratic variation of w over [0,t] is t.
zeros of the function w are a nowhere dense perfect set of lebesgue measure 0 and hausdorff dimension 1/2 (therefore, uncountable).

==== local time ====
the image of the lebesgue measure on [0, t] under the map w (the pushforward measure) has a density lt(·).  thus,

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            0

        f
        (
        w
        (
        s
        )
        )
        
        
          d
        
        s
        =
        
          ∫
          
            −
            ∞
          
          
            +
            ∞
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
          l
          
            t
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
        
          d
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{0}^{t}f(w(s))\,\mathrm {d} s=\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }f(x)l_{t}(x)\,\mathrm {d} x}
  for a wide class of functions f (namely: all continuous functions; all locally integrable functions; all non-negative measurable functions). the density lt is (more exactly, can and will be chosen to be) continuous. the number lt(x) is called the local time at x of w on [0, t]. it is strictly positive for all x of the interval (a, b) where a and b are the least and the greatest value of w on [0, t], respectively. (for x outside this interval the local time evidently vanishes.) treated as a function of two variables x and t, the local time is still continuous. treated as a function of t (while x is fixed), the local time is a singular function corresponding to a nonatomic measure on the set of zeros of w.
these continuity properties are fairly non-trivial. consider that the local time can also be defined (as the density of the pushforward measure) for a smooth function. then, however,  the density is discontinuous, unless the given function is monotone. in other words, there is a conflict between good behavior of a function and good behavior of its local time. in this sense, the continuity of the local time of the wiener process is another manifestation of non-smoothness of the trajectory.


=== information rate ===
the information rate of the wiener process with respect to the squared error distance, i.e. its quadratic rate-distortion function, is given by 

  
    
      
        r
        (
        d
        )
        =
        
          
            2

              ln
              ⁡
              2

  is called a wiener process with drift μ and infinitesimal variance σ2. these processes exhaust continuous lévy processes.
two random processes on the time interval [0, 1] appear, roughly speaking, when conditioning the wiener process to vanish on both ends of [0,1]. with no further conditioning, the process takes both positive and negative values on [0, 1] and is called brownian bridge. conditioned also to stay positive on (0, 1), the process is called brownian excursion. in both cases a rigorous treatment involves a limiting procedure, since the formula p(a|b) = p(a ∩ b)/p(b)  does not apply when p(b) = 0.

the time of hitting a single point x > 0 by the wiener process is a random variable with the lévy distribution. the family of these random variables (indexed by all positive numbers x) is a left-continuous modification of a lévy process. the right-continuous modification of this process is given by times of first exit from closed intervals [0, x].
the local time l = (lxt)x ∈ r, t ≥ 0 of a brownian motion describes the time that the process spends at the point x. formally

=== brownian martingales ===
let a be an event related to the wiener process (more formally: a set, measurable with respect to the wiener   measure, in the space of functions), and xt the conditional probability of a given the wiener process on the time interval [0, t] (more formally: the wiener measure of the set of trajectories whose concatenation with the given partial trajectory on [0, t] belongs to a). then the process xt is a continuous martingale. its martingale property follows immediately from the definitions, but its continuity is a very special fact – a special case of a general theorem stating that all brownian martingales are continuous. a brownian martingale is, by definition, a martingale adapted to the brownian filtration; and the brownian filtration is, by definition, the filtration generated by the wiener process.

in contrast to the real-valued case, a complex-valued martingale is generally not a time-changed complex-valued wiener process. for example, the martingale 
  
    
      
        2
        
          x

    {\displaystyle 2x_{t}+iy_{t}}
   is not (here 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            t

            t
