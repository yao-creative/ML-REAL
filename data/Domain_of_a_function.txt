in mathematics, the domain of a function is the set of inputs accepted by the function. it is sometimes denoted by 
  
    
      
        dom
        ⁡
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {dom} (f)}
  , where f is the function.
more precisely, given a function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\colon x\to y}
  , the domain of f is x. note that in modern mathematical language, the domain is part of the definition of a function rather than a property of it.
in the special case that x and y are both subsets of 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  , the function f can be graphed in the cartesian coordinate system. in this case, the domain is represented on the x-axis of the graph, as the projection of the graph of the function onto the x-axis.
for a function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\colon x\to y}
  , the set y is called the codomain, and the set of values attained by the function (which is a subset of y) is called its range or image.
any function can be restricted to a subset of its domain. the restriction of 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\colon x\to y}
   to 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  , where 
  
    
      
        a
        ⊆
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\subseteq x}
  , is written as 
  
    
      
        
          
            
            f
            |
          
          
            a
          
        
        :
        a
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left.f\right|_{a}\colon a\to y}
  .


== natural domain ==
if a real function f is given by a formula, it may be not defined for some values of the variable. in this case, it is a partial function, and the set of real numbers on which the formula can be evaluated to a real number is called the natural domain or domain of definition of f. in many contexts, a partial function is called simply a function, and its natural domain is called simply its domain.

== other uses ==

the word "domain" is used with other related meanings in some areas of mathematics. in topology, a domain is a connected open set. in real and complex analysis, a domain is an open connected subset of a real or complex vector space. in the study of partial differential equations, a domain is the open connected subset of the euclidean space 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   where a problem is posed (i.e., where the unknown function(s) are defined).


== set theoretical notions ==
for example, it is sometimes convenient in set theory to permit the domain of a function to be a proper class x, in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple (x, y, g). with such a definition, functions do not have a domain, although some authors still use it informally after introducing a function in the form f: x → y.
