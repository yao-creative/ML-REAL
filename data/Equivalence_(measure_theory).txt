in mathematics, and specifically in measure theory, equivalence is a notion of two measures being qualitatively similar. specifically, the two measures agree on which events have measure zero.

let 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   and 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
   be two measures on the measurable space 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        
          
            a
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,{\mathcal {a}})}
  , and let

        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {n}}_{\mu }:=\{a\in {\mathcal {a}}\mid \mu (a)=0\}}
  and

  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
            
          
          
            ν

        ν
        (
        a
        )
        =
        0
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {n}}_{\nu }:=\{a\in {\mathcal {a}}\mid \nu (a)=0\}}
  be the sets of 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  -null sets and 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
  -null sets, respectively. then the measure 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
   is said to be absolutely continuous in reference to 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   iff 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
            
          
          
            ν
          
        
        ⊇

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {n}}_{\nu }\supseteq {\mathcal {n}}_{\mu }}
  . this is denoted as 
  
    
      
        ν
        ≪
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu \ll \mu }
  .
the two measures are called equivalent iff 
  
    
      
        μ
        ≪
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu \ll \nu }

        ν
        ≪
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu \ll \mu }
  , which is denoted as 
  
    
      
        μ
        ∼
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu \sim \nu }
  . that is, two measures are equivalent if they satisfy 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
            
          
          
            μ
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              n
            
          
          
            ν
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {n}}_{\mu }={\mathcal {n}}_{\nu }}
  .

=== on the real line ===
define the two measures on the real line as

  
    
      
        μ
        (
        a
        )
        =
        
          ∫
          
            a
          
        
        
          
            1
          
          
            [
            0
            ,
            1
            ]
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          d
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu (a)=\int _{a}\mathbf {1} _{[0,1]}(x)\mathrm {d} x}
  

  
    
      
        ν
        (
        a
        )
        =
        
          ∫
          
            a
          
        
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        
          
            1
          
          
            [
            0
            ,
            1
            ]
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        
          d
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu (a)=\int _{a}x^{2}\mathbf {1} _{[0,1]}(x)\mathrm {d} x}
  for all borel sets 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  . then 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   and 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
   are equivalent, since all sets outside of 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1]}
   have 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   and 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
   measure zero, and a set inside 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1]}
   is a 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  -null set or a 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
  -null set exactly when it is a null set with respect to lebesgue measure.


=== abstract measure space ===
look at some measurable space 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        
          
            a
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,{\mathcal {a}})}
   and let 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   be the counting measure, so

  
    
      
        μ
        (
        a
        )
        =
        
          |
        
        a
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu (a)=|a|}
  ,where 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        a
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |a|}
   is the cardinality of the set a. so the counting measure has only one null set, which is the empty set. that is, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              n
            
          
          
            μ
          
        
        =
        {
        ∅
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {n}}_{\mu }=\{\emptyset \}}
  . so by the second definition, any other measure 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
   is equivalent to the counting measure iff it also has just the empty set as the only 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
  -null set.


== supporting measures ==
a measure 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   is called a supporting measure of a measure 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
   if 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   is 
  
    
      
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma }
  -finite and 
  
    
      
        ν
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu }
   is equivalent to 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
  .
