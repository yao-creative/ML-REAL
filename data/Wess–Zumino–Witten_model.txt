in theoretical physics and mathematics, a wess–zumino–witten (wzw) model, also called a wess–zumino–novikov–witten model, is a type of two-dimensional conformal field theory named after julius wess, bruno zumino, sergei novikov and edward witten. a wzw model is associated to a lie group (or supergroup), and its symmetry algebra is the affine lie algebra built from the corresponding lie algebra (or lie superalgebra). by extension, the name wzw model is sometimes used for any conformal field theory whose symmetry algebra is an affine lie algebra.

=== topological properties of the wess–zumino term ===
for the wess–zumino term to make sense, we need the field 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   to have an extension to 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {b} ^{3}}
  . this requires the homotopy group 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            2
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{2}(g)}
   to be trivial, which is the case in particular for any compact lie group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  . 
the extension of a given 
  
    
      
        γ
        :
        σ
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma :\sigma \to g}
   to 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {b} ^{3}}
   is in general not unique. 
for the wzw model to be well-defined, 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            i
            
              s
              
                k
              
            
            (
            γ
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{is_{k}(\gamma )}}
   
should not depend on the choice of the extension. 
the wess–zumino term is invariant under small deformations of 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
  , and only depends on its homotopy class. 
possible homotopy classes are controlled by the homotopy group 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            3
          
        
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{3}(g)}
  .
for any compact, connected simple lie group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  , we have 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            3
          
        
        (
        g
        )
        =
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{3}(g)=\mathbb {z} }
  , and different extensions of 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   lead to values of 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            
              w
            
            z
          
        
        (
        γ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{\mathrm {w} z}(\gamma )}
   that differ by integers. therefore, they lead to the same value of 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            i
            
              s
              
                k
              
            
            (
            γ
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{is_{k}(\gamma )}}
   provided the level obeys 

  
    
      
        k
        ∈
        
          z
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {z} .}
  integer values of the level also play an important role in the representation theory of the model's symmetry algebra, which is an affine lie algebra. if the level is a positive integer, the affine lie algebra has unitary highest weight representations with highest weights that are dominant integral. such representations decompose into finite-dimensional subrepresentations with respect to the subalgebras spanned by each simple root, the corresponding negative root and their commutator, which is a cartan generator. 
in the case of the noncompact simple lie group 
  
    
      
        
          s
          l
        
        (
        2
        ,
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {sl} (2,\mathbb {r} )}
  ,
the homotopy group 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            3
          
        
        (
        
          s
          l
        
        (
        2
        ,
        
          r
        
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{3}(\mathrm {sl} (2,\mathbb {r} ))}
   is trivial, and the level is not constrained to be an integer.


=== geometrical interpretation of the wess–zumino term ===
if ea are the basis vectors for the lie algebra, then 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
          
        
        (
        
          e
          
            a
          
        
        ,
        [
        
          e
          
            b
          
        
        ,
        
          e
          
            c
          
        
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {k}}(e_{a},[e_{b},e_{c}])}
   are the structure constants of the lie algebra. the structure constants are completely anti-symmetric, and thus they define a 3-form on the group manifold of g. thus, the integrand above is just the pullback of the harmonic 3-form to the ball 
  
    
      
        
          
            b

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {b} ^{3}.}
   denoting the harmonic 3-form by c and the pullback by 
  
    
      
        
          γ

  this form leads directly to a topological analysis of the wz term.
geometrically, this term describes the torsion of the respective manifold. the presence of this torsion compels teleparallelism of the manifold, and thus trivialization of the torsionful curvature tensor; and hence arrest of the renormalization flow, an infrared fixed point of the renormalization group, a phenomenon termed geometrostasis.

=== sugawara construction ===
the sugawara construction is an embedding of the virasoro algebra into the universal enveloping algebra of the affine lie algebra. the existence of the embedding shows that wzw models are conformal field theories. moreover, it leads to knizhnik–zamolodchikov equations for correlation functions.
the sugawara construction is most concisely written at the level of the currents: 
  
    
      
        
          j

=== wzw models with compact, simply connected groups ===
if the lie group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is compact and simply connected, then the wzw model is rational and diagonal: rational because the spectrum is built from a (level-dependent) finite set of irreducible representations of the affine lie algebra called the integrable highest weight representations, and diagonal because a representation of the left-moving algebra is coupled with the same representation of the right-moving algebra.for example, the spectrum of the

=== wzw models with other types of groups ===
if the group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is compact but not simply connected, the wzw model is rational but not necessarily diagonal. for example, the 
  
    
      
        s
        o
        (
        3
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle so(3)}
   wzw model exists for even integer levels 
  
    
      
        k
        ∈
        2
        
          n
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\in 2\mathbb {n} }
  , and its spectrum is a non-diagonal combination of finitely many integrable highest weight representations.if the group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is not compact, the wzw model is non-rational. moreover, its spectrum may include non highest weight representations. for example, the spectrum of the 
  
    
      
        s
        l
        (
        2
        ,
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle sl(2,\mathbb {r} )}
   wzw model is built from highest weight representations, plus their images under the spectral flow automorphisms of the affine lie algebra.if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is a supergroup, the spectrum may involve representations that do not factorize as tensor products of representations of the left- and right-moving symmetry algebras. this occurs for example in the case 
  
    
      
        g
        =
        g
        l
        (
        1
        
          |
        
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g=gl(1|1)}
  ,
and also in more complicated supergroups such as 
  
    
      
        g
        =
        p
        s
        u
        (
        1
        ,
        1
        
          |
        
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g=psu(1,1|2)}
  .
non-factorizable representations are responsible for the fact that the corresponding wzw models are logarithmic conformal field theories.


=== other theories based on affine lie algebras ===
the known conformal field theories based on affine lie algebras are not limited to wzw models.
for example, in the case of the affine lie algebra of the 
  
    
      
        s
        u
        (
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle su(2)}
   wzw model, modular invariant torus partition functions obey an ade classification, where the 
  
    
      
        s
        u
        (
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle su(2)}
   wzw model accounts for the a series only. the d series corresponds to the 
  
    
      
        s
        o
        (
        3
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle so(3)}
   wzw model, and the e series does not correspond to any wzw model.
another example is the 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            3
          
          
            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{3}^{+}}
   model. this model is based on the same symmetry algebra as the 
  
    
      
        s
        l
        (
        2
        ,
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle sl(2,\mathbb {r} )}
   wzw model, to which it is related by wick rotation. however, the 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            3
          
          
            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{3}^{+}}
   is not strictly speaking a wzw model, as 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            3
          
          
            +
          
        
        =
        s
        l
        (
        2
        ,
        
          c
        
        )
        
          /
        
        s
        u
        (
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{3}^{+}=sl(2,\mathbb {c} )/su(2)}
   is not a group, but a coset.

  by the state-field correspondence, affine primary fields correspond to affine primary states, which are the highest weight states of highest weight representations of the affine lie algebra. 


=== correlation functions ===
if the group 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is compact, the spectrum of the wzw model is made of highest weight representations, and all correlation functions can be deduced from correlation functions of affine primary fields via ward identities.
if the riemann surface 
  
    
      
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma }
   is the riemann sphere, correlation functions of affine primary fields obey knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations. on riemann surfaces of higher genus, correlation functions obey knizhnik-zamolodchikov-bernard equations, which involve derivatives not only of the fields' positions, but also of the surface's moduli.

   gauged wzw model has an interpretation in string theory as witten's two-dimensional euclidean black hole.
the same model also describes certain two-dimensional statistical systems at criticality, such as the critical antiferromagnetic potts model.
