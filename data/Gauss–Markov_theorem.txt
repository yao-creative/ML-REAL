in statistics, the gauss–markov theorem (or simply gauss theorem for some authors) states that the ordinary least squares (ols) estimator has the lowest sampling variance within the class of linear unbiased estimators, if the errors in the linear regression model are uncorrelated, have equal variances and expectation value of zero. the errors do not need to be normal, nor do they need to be independent and identically distributed (only uncorrelated with mean zero and homoscedastic with finite variance). the requirement that the estimator be unbiased cannot be dropped, since biased estimators exist with lower variance. see, for example, the james–stein estimator (which also drops linearity), ridge regression, or simply any degenerate estimator.
the theorem was named after carl friedrich gauss and andrey markov, although gauss' work significantly predates markov's. but while gauss derived the result under the assumption of independence and normality, markov reduced the assumptions to the form stated above. a further generalization to non-spherical errors was given by alexander aitken.

  the theorem now states that the ols estimator is a blue. the main idea of the proof is that the least-squares estimator is uncorrelated with every linear unbiased estimator of zero, i.e., with every linear combination

=== remark ===
proof that the ols indeed minimizes the sum of squares of residuals may proceed as follows with a calculation of the hessian matrix and showing that it is positive definite. 
the mse function we want to minimize is 

for a multiple regression model with p variables. the first derivative is 

where x is the design matrix 

the hessian matrix of second derivatives is 

assuming the columns of

          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {k} }

            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {h}}}

            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {h}}}

   which gives the uniqueness of the ols estimator as a blue.


== generalized least squares estimator ==
the generalized least squares (gls), developed by aitken, extends the gauss–markov theorem to the case where the error vector has a non-scalar covariance matrix. the aitken estimator is also a blue.

in most treatments of ols, the regressors (parameters of interest) in the design matrix

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
   are assumed to be fixed in repeated samples. this assumption is considered inappropriate for a predominantly nonexperimental science like econometrics. instead, the assumptions of the gauss–markov theorem are stated conditional on

=== linearity ===
the dependent variable is assumed to be a linear function of the variables specified in the model. the specification must be linear in its parameters. this does not mean that there must be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. the independent variables can take non-linear forms as long as the parameters are linear.  the equation

data transformations are often used to convert an equation into a linear form. for example, the cobb–douglas function—often used in economics—is nonlinear:

  
    
      
        y
        =
        a
        
          l
          
            α
          
        
        
          k
          
            1
            −
            α
          
        
        
          e
          
            ε
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=al^{\alpha }k^{1-\alpha }e^{\varepsilon }}
  but it can be expressed in linear form by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

  
    
      
        ln
        ⁡
        y
        =

        )
        ln
        ⁡
        k
        +
        ε
        =
        
          β
          
            0
          
        
        +
        
          β
          
            1
          
        
        ln
        ⁡
        l
        +
        
          β
          
            2
          
        
        ln
        ⁡
        k
        +
        ε
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ln y=\ln a+\alpha \ln l+(1-\alpha )\ln k+\varepsilon =\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}\ln l+\beta _{2}\ln k+\varepsilon }
  this assumption also covers specification issues: assuming that the proper functional form has been selected and there are no omitted variables.
one should be aware, however, that the parameters that minimize the residuals of the transformed equation do not necessarily minimize the residuals of the original equation.

  this assumption is violated if the explanatory variables are stochastic, for instance when they are measured with error, or are endogenous. endogeneity can be the result of simultaneity, where causality flows back and forth between both the dependent and independent variable. instrumental variable techniques are commonly used to address this problem.

   is not invertible and the ols estimator cannot be computed.
a violation of this assumption is perfect multicollinearity, i.e. some explanatory variables are linearly dependent. one scenario in which this will occur is called "dummy variable trap," when a base dummy variable is not omitted resulting in perfect correlation between the dummy variables and the constant term.multicollinearity (as long as it is not "perfect") can be present resulting in a less efficient, but still unbiased estimate. the estimates will be less precise and highly sensitive to particular sets of data. multicollinearity can be detected from condition number or the variance inflation factor, among other tests.

  this implies the error term has uniform variance (homoscedasticity) and no serial dependence. if this assumption is violated, ols is still unbiased, but inefficient. the term "spherical errors" will describe the multivariate normal distribution: if

        ⁡
        [

   in the multivariate normal density, then the equation 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        ε

        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\varepsilon )=c}
   is the formula for a ball centered at μ with radius σ in n-dimensional space.heteroskedasticity occurs when the amount of error is correlated with an independent variable. for example, in a regression on food expenditure and income, the error is correlated with income.  low income people generally spend a similar amount on food, while high income people may spend a very large amount or as little as low income people spend. heteroskedastic can also be caused by changes in measurement practices. for example, as statistical offices improve their data, measurement error decreases, so the error term declines over time.
this assumption is violated when there is autocorrelation.  autocorrelation can be visualized on a data plot when a given observation is more likely to lie above a fitted line if adjacent observations also lie above the fitted regression line. autocorrelation is common in time series data where a data series may experience "inertia." if a dependent variable takes a while to fully absorb a shock. spatial autocorrelation can also occur geographic areas are likely to have similar errors. autocorrelation may be the result of misspecification such as choosing the wrong functional form. in these cases, correcting the specification is one possible way to deal with autocorrelation.
in the presence of spherical errors, the generalized least squares estimator can be shown to be blue.
