in fractional calculus, an area of mathematical analysis, the differintegral is a combined  differentiation/integration operator. applied to a function ƒ, the q-differintegral of f, here denoted by

  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
          
            q
          
        
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {d} ^{q}f}
  is the fractional derivative (if q > 0) or fractional integral (if q < 0).  if q = 0, then the q-th differintegral of a function is the function itself.  in the context of fractional integration and differentiation, there are several legitimate definitions of the differintegral.


== standard definitions ==
the four most common forms are:

the riemann–liouville differintegralthis is the simplest and easiest to use, and consequently it is the most often used. it is a generalization of the cauchy formula for repeated integration to arbitrary order. here, 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        ⌈
        q
        ⌉
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=\lceil q\rceil }
  . 
the grunwald–letnikov differintegralthe grunwald–letnikov differintegral is a direct generalization of the definition of a derivative.  it is more difficult to use than the riemann–liouville differintegral, but can sometimes be used to solve problems that the riemann–liouville cannot. 
the weyl differintegral this is formally similar to the riemann–liouville differintegral, but applies to periodic functions, with integral zero over a period.
the caputo differintegralin opposite to the riemann-liouville differintegral, caputo derivative of a constant

        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(t)}
   is equal to zero. moreover, a form of the laplace transform allows to simply evaluate the initial conditions by computing finite, integer-order derivatives at point

recall the continuous fourier transform, here denoted 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
  :

using the continuous fourier transform, in fourier space, differentiation transforms into a multiplication:

so,

which generalizes to
