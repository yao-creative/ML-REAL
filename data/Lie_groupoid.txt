in mathematics, a lie groupoid is a groupoid where the set 
  
    
      
        ob
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ob} }
   of objects and the set 
  
    
      
        mor
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {mor} }
   of morphisms are both manifolds, all the category operations (source and target, composition, identity-assigning map and inversion) are smooth, and the source and target operations

  
    
      
        s
        ,
        t
        :
        mor
        →
        ob
      
    
    {\displaystyle s,t:\operatorname {mor} \to \operatorname {ob} }
  are submersions.
a lie groupoid can thus be thought of as a "many-object generalization" of a lie group, just as a groupoid is a many-object generalization of a group. accordingly, while lie groups provide a natural model for (classical) continuous symmetries, lie groupoids are often used as model for (and arise from) generalised, point-dependent symmetries. extending the correspondence between lie groups and lie algebras, lie groupoids are the global counterparts of lie algebroids.
lie groupoids have been introduced by charles ehresmann under the name differentiable groupoids.


== definition and basic concepts ==
a lie groupoid consists of

two smooth manifolds 
  
    
      
        g

  .using the language of category theory, a lie groupoid can be more compactly defined as a groupoid (i.e. a small category where all the morphisms are invertible) such that the sets 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   of objects and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   of morphisms are manifolds, the maps 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  , 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  , 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  , 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   and 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   are smooth and 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   and 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   are submersions. a lie groupoid is therefore not simply a groupoid object in the category of smooth manifolds: one has to ask the additional property that 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   and 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   are submersions.
lie groupoids are often denoted by 
  
    
      
        g
        ⇉
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\rightrightarrows m}
  , where the two arrows represent the source and the target. the notation 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ⇉
        
          g
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{1}\rightrightarrows g_{0}}
   is also frequently used, especially when stressing the simplicial structure of the associated nerve.


=== alternative definitions ===
the original definition by ehresmann required 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   and 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   to possess a smooth structure such that only 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is smooth and the maps 
  
    
      
        g
        ↦
        
          1

    {\displaystyle g\mapsto 1_{s(g)}}
   and

            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\mapsto 1_{t(g)}}
   are subimmersions (i.e. have locally constant rank). such definition proved to be too weak and was replaced by pradines with the one currently used.while some authors introduced weaker definitions which did not require 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   and 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   to be submersions, these properties are fundamental to develop the entire lie theory of groupoids and algebroids.

=== bisections ===

   is a diffeomorphism of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}

the group of bisections can be given the compact-open topology, as well as an (infinite-dimensional) structure of fréchet manifold compatible with the group structure, making it into a fréchet-lie group.
a local bisection 
  
    
      
        b
        :
        u
        ⊆
        m
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle b:u\subseteq m\to g}
   is defined analogously, but the multiplication between local bisections is of course only partially defined.

== important classes of lie groupoids ==
note that some of the following classes make sense already in the category of set-theoretical or topological groupoids.


=== transitive groupoids ===
a lie groupoid is transitive (in older literature also called connected) if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:

there is only one orbit;
there is at least a morphism between any two objects;
the map 
  
    
      
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
        :
        g
        →
        m
        ×
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle (s,t):g\to m\times m}
   (also known as the anchor of 
  
    
      
        g
        ⇉
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\rightrightarrows m}
  ) is surjective.gauge groupoids constitute the prototypical examples of transitive lie groupoids: indeed, any transitive lie groupoid is isomorphic to the gauge groupoid of some principal bundle, namely the 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            x

  -bundle 
  
    
      
        t
        :
        
          s
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        →
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle t:s^{-1}(x)\to m}
  , for any point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in m}
  . for instance:

  ;
an action groupoid

        m
        ⇉
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\times m\rightrightarrows m}
   is transitive if and only if the group action is transitive, and in such case it arises from the principal bundle 
  
    
      
        g
        →
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\to m}
   with structure group the isotropy group (at an arbitrary point);
the general linear groupoid of 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is transitive, and arises from the frame bundle 
  
    
      
        f
        r
        (
        e

  ;
pullback groupoids, jet groupoids and tangent groupoids of 
  
    
      
        g
        ⇉
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\rightrightarrows m}
   are transitive if and only if 
  
    
      
        g
        ⇉
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\rightrightarrows m}
   is transitive.as a less trivial instance of the correspondence between transitive lie groupoids and principal bundles, consider the fundamental groupoid 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            1
          
        
        (
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(m)}
   of a (connected) smooth manifold m. this is naturally a topological groupoid, which is moreover transitive; one can see that 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            1
          
        
        (
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(m)}
   is isomorphic to the gauge groupoid of the universal cover of m. accordingly, 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            1
          
        
        (
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{1}(m)}
   inherits a smooth structure which makes it into a lie groupoid.


=== proper groupoids ===
a lie groupoid is called proper if 
  
    
      
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
        :
        g
        →
        m
        ×
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle (s,t):g\to m\times m}
   is a proper map. as a consequence

all isotropy groups of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are compact;
all orbits of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are closed submanifolds;
the orbit space 
  
    
      
        m
        
          /
        
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle m/g}
   is hausdorff.for instance:

a lie group is proper if and only if it is compact;
pair groupoids are always proper;
unit groupoids are always proper;
an action groupoid is proper if and only if the action is proper;
the fundamental groupoid is proper if and only if the fundamental groups are finite.as seen above, properness for lie groupoids is the "right" analogue of compactness for lie groups. one could also consider more "natural" conditions, e.g. asking that the source map 
  
    
      
        s
        :
        g
        →
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle s:g\to m}
   is proper (then 
  
    
      
        g
        ⇉
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\rightrightarrows m}
   is called s-proper), or that the entire space 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is compact (then 
  
    
      
        g
        ⇉
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\rightrightarrows m}
   is called compact), but these requirements turns out to be too strict for many examples and applications.


=== étale groupoids ===
a lie groupoid is called étale if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:

the dimensions of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   and 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   are equal;

  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is a local diffeomorphism;
all the 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  -fibres are discreteas a consequence, also the 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  -fibres, the isotropy groups and the orbits become discrete.
for instance:

a lie group is étale if and only if it is discrete;
pair groupoids are never étale;
unit groupoids are always étale;
an action groupoid is étale if and only if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is discrete;
fundamental groupoids are always étale (but fundamental groupoids of a foliations are not);
germ groupoids of pseudogroups are always étale.


=== effective groupoids ===
an étale groupoid is called effective if, for any two local bisections 
  
    
      
        
          b

lie groups are effective if and only if are trivial;
unit groupoids are always effective;
an action groupoid is effective if the 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -action is free and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is discrete.in general, any effective étale groupoid arise as the germ groupoid of some pseudogroup. however, a (more involved) definition of effectiveness, which does not assume the étale property, can also be given.


=== source-connected groupoids ===
a lie groupoid is called s-connected if all its s-fibres are connected. similarly, one talks about s-simply connected groupoids (when the s-fibres are simply connected) or source-k-connected groupoids (when the s-fibres are k-connected, i.e. the first 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   homotopy groups are trivial).
note that the entire space of arrows 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is not asked to satisfy any connectedness hypothesis. however, if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is a source-
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected lie groupoid over a 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected manifold, then 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   itself is automatically 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected.
for instanceː

lie groups are source 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected if and only are 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected;
a pair groupoid is source 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected if and only if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected;
unit groupoids are always source 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected;
action groupoids are source 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected if and only if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -connected.
monodromy groupoids (hence also fundamental groupoids) are source simply connected.

=== the lie algebroid of a lie groupoid ===

any lie groupoid 
  
    
      
        g
        ⇉
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\rightrightarrows m}
   has an associated lie algebroid 
  
    
      
        a
        →
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\to m}
  , obtained with a construction similar to the one which associates a lie algebra to any lie groupː

the vector bundle 
  
    
      
        a
        →
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\to m}
   is the vertical bundle with respect to the source map, restricted to the elements tangent to the identities, i.e. 
  
    
      
        a
        :=
        ker
        ⁡
        (
        d
        s
        
          )
          
            ∣
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a:=\ker(ds)_{\mid m}}
  ;
the lie bracket is obtained by identifying 
  
    
      
        γ
        (
        a
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma (a)}
   with the left-invariant vector fields on 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  , and by transporting their lie bracket to 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  ;
the anchor map 
  
    
      
        a
        →
        t
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\to tm}
   is the differential of the target map 
  
    
      
        t
        :
        g
        →
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle t:g\to m}
   restricted to 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  .the lie group–lie algebra correspondence generalises to some extends also to lie groupoids: the first two lie's theorem (also known as the subgroups–subalgebras theorem and the homomorphisms theorem) can indeed be easily adapted to this setting.
in particular, as in standard lie theory, for any s-connected lie groupoid 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   there is a unique (up to isomorphism) s-simply connected lie groupoid 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              g
              ~
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tilde {g}}}
   with the same lie algebroid of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  , and a local diffeomorphism 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              g
              ~
            
          
        
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tilde {g}}\to g}
   which is a groupoid morphism. for instance,

   (since the homotopy classes are smaller than the holonomy ones).however, there is no analogue of lie's third theoremː while several classes of lie algebroids are integrable, there are examples of lie algebroids, for instance related to foliation theory, which do not admit an integrating lie groupoid. the general obstructions to the existence of such integration depend on the topology of

  .


== morita equivalence ==
as discussed above, the standard notion of (iso)morphism of groupoids (viewed as functors between categories) restricts naturally to lie groupoids. however, there is a more coarse notation of equivalence, called morita equivalence, which is more flexible and useful in applications.
first, a morita map (also known as a weak equivalence or essential equivalence) between two lie groupoids 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ⇉
        
          g
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{1}\rightrightarrows g_{0}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            1
          
        
        ⇉
        
          h
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{1}\rightrightarrows h_{0}}
   consists of a lie groupoid morphism from g to h which is moreover fully faithful and essentially surjective (adapting these categorical notions to the smooth context). we say that two lie groupoids 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ⇉
        
          g
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{1}\rightrightarrows g_{0}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            1
          
        
        ⇉
        
          h
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{1}\rightrightarrows h_{0}}
   are morita equivalent if and only if there exists a third lie groupoid 
  
    
      
        
          k
          
            1
          
        
        ⇉
        
          k
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle k_{1}\rightrightarrows k_{0}}
   together with two morita maps from g to k and from h to k.
a more explicit description of morita equivalence (e.g. useful to check that it is an equivalence relation) requires the existence of two surjective submersions 
  
    
      
        p
        →
        
          g
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\to g_{0}}
   and 
  
    
      
        p
        →
        
          h
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\to h_{0}}
   together with a left 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  -action and a right 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
  -action, commuting with each other and making 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   into a principal bi-bundle.


=== morita invariance ===
many properties of lie groupoids, e.g. being proper, being hausdorff or being transitive, are morita invariant. on the other hand, being étale is not morita invariant.

  . as such, čech groupoids associated to different open covers of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   are morita equivalent.


=== smooth stacks ===
investigating the structure of the orbit space of a lie groupoid leads to the notion of a smooth stack. for instance, the orbit space is a smooth manifold if the isotropy groups are trivial (as in the example of the čech groupoid), but it is not smooth in general. the solution is to revert the problem and to define a smooth stack as a morita-equivalence class of lie groupoids. the natural geometric objects living on the stack are the geometric objects on lie groupoids invariant under morita-equivalence: an example is the lie groupoid cohomology.
since the notion of smooth stack is quite general, obviously all smooth manifolds are smooth stacks. other classes of examples include orbifolds, which are (equivalence classes of) proper étale lie groupoids, and orbit spaces of foliations.
