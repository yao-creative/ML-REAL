in mathematics, an algebraic stack is a vast generalization of algebraic spaces, or schemes, which are foundational for studying moduli theory. many moduli spaces are constructed using techniques specific to algebraic stacks, such as artin's representability theorem, which is used to construct the moduli space of pointed algebraic curves 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              m
            
          
          
            g
            ,
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {m}}_{g,n}}
   and the moduli stack of elliptic curves. originally, they were introduced by grothendieck to keep track of automorphisms on moduli spaces, a technique which allows for treating these moduli spaces as if their underlying schemes or algebraic spaces are smooth. but, through many generalizations the notion of algebraic stacks was finally discovered by michael artin.

=== motivation ===
one of the motivating examples of an algebraic stack is to consider a groupoid scheme 
  
    
      
        (
        r
        ,
        u
        ,
        s

        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (r,u,s,t,m)}
   over a fixed scheme 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}

            n
          
        
        (
        k
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{n}(k)}
  . note that in order to get an algebraic stack from 
  
    
      
        [
        u
        
          /
        
        r
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [u/r]}
  , and not just a stack, there are additional technical hypotheses required for 
  
    
      
        [
        u
        
          /
        
        r
        ]

  .

it turns out using the fppf-topology (faithfully flat and locally of finite presentation) on

==== explanation of technical conditions ====


===== using the fppf topology =====
first of all, the fppf-topology is used because it behaves well with respect to descent. for example, if there are schemes 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        ob
        ⁡
        (
        
          s
          c
          h
        
        
          /
        
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y\in \operatorname {ob} (\mathrm {sch} /s)}
   and 
  
    
      
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\to y}
  can be refined to an fppf-cover of

=== deligne-mumford stacks ===
algebraic stacks, also known as artin stacks, are by definition equipped with a smooth surjective atlas 
  
    
      
        
          
            u

            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}\to {\mathcal {x}}}
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}}
   is the stack associated to some scheme 
  
    
      
        u
        →
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\to s}
  . if the atlas 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
        →
        
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}\to {\mathcal {x}}}
   is moreover étale, then 
  
    
      
        
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {x}}}
   is said to be a deligne-mumford stack. the subclass of deligne-mumford stacks is useful because it provides the correct setting for many natural stacks considered, such as the moduli stack of algebraic curves. in addition, they are strict enough that object represented by points in deligne-mumford stacks do not have infinitesimal automorphisms. this is very important because infinitesimal automorphisms make studying the deformation theory of artin stacks very difficult. for example, the deformation theory of the artin stack 
  
    
      
        b
        g
        
          l
          
            n
          
        
        =
        [
        ∗
        
          /
        
        g
        
          l
          
            n
          
        
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle bgl_{n}=[*/gl_{n}]}
  , the moduli stack of rank 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   vector bundles, has infinitesimal automorphisms controlled partially by the lie algebra 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              g
              l
            
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {gl}}_{n}}
  . this leads to an infinite sequence of deformations and obstructions in general, which is one of the motivations for studying moduli of stable bundles. only in the special case of the deformation theory of line bundles 
  
    
      
        [
        ∗
        
          /
        
        g
        
          l
          
            1
          
        
        ]
        =
        [
        ∗
        
          /
        
        
          
            g
          
          
            m
          
        
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [*/gl_{1}]=[*/\mathbb {g} _{m}]}
   is the deformation theory tractable, since the associated lie algebra is abelian.

note that many stacks cannot be naturally represented as deligne-mumford stacks because it only allows for finite covers, or, algebraic stacks with finite covers. note that because every etale cover is flat and locally of finite presentation, algebraic stacks defined with the fppf-topology subsume this theory; but, it is still useful since many stacks found in nature are of this form, such as the moduli of curves 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              m
            
          
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {m}}_{g}}
  . also, the differential-geometric analogue of such stacks are called orbifolds. the etale condition implies the 2-functor
  
    
      
        b
        
          μ

    {\displaystyle \mu _{n}}
  -torsors is representable as a stack over the etale topology, but the picard-stack 
  
    
      
        b
        
          
            g
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\mathbb {g} _{m}}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          
            g

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {g} _{m}}
  -torsors (equivalently the category of line bundles) is not representable. stacks of this form are representable as stacks over the fppf-topology.
another reason for considering the fppf-topology versus the etale topology is over characteristic 
  
    
      
        p

            m

        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\to \mu _{p}\to \mathbb {g} _{m}\to \mathbb {g} _{m}\to 0}
  is exact only as a sequence of fppf sheaves, but not as a sequence of etale sheaves.

the structure sheaf of an algebraic stack is an object pulled back from a universal structure sheaf

    {\displaystyle p^{-1}}
   comes from the map of grothendieck topologies. in particular, this means is 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        
          ob

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in {\text{ob}}({\mathcal {x}})}
   lies over 
  
    
      
        u

        =

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{\mathcal {x}}(x)=\gamma (u,{\mathcal {o}}_{u})}
  . as a sanity check, it's worth comparing this to a category fibered in groupoids coming from an

  , the structure sheaf for an open subscheme 
  
    
      
        u
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\to x}
   gives

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {o}}_{\mathcal {x}}(u)={\mathcal {o}}_{x}(u)=\gamma (u,{\mathcal {o}}_{x})}
  so this definition recovers the classic structure sheaf on a scheme. moreover, for a quotient stack 
  
    
      
        
          
            x

=== classifying stacks ===

many classifying stacks for algebraic groups are algebraic stacks. in fact, for an algebraic group space 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   over a scheme 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   which is flat of finite presentation, the stack 
  
    
      
        b
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle bg}
   is algebraictheorem 6.1.
