in mathematics, a klein geometry is a type of geometry motivated by felix klein in his influential erlangen program. more specifically, it is a homogeneous space x together with a transitive action on x by a lie group g, which acts as the symmetry group of the geometry.
for background and motivation see the article on the erlangen program.


== formal definition ==
a klein geometry is a pair (g, h) where g is a lie group and h is a closed lie subgroup of g such that the (left) coset space g/h is connected. the group g is called the principal group of the geometry and g/h is called the space of the geometry (or, by an abuse of terminology, simply the klein geometry). the space x = g/h of a klein geometry is a smooth manifold of dimension

dim x = dim g − dim h.there is a natural smooth left action of g on x given by

  
    
      
        g
        ⋅
        (
        a
        h
        )
        =
        (
        g
        a
        )
        h
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\cdot (ah)=(ga)h.}
  clearly, this action is transitive (take a = 1), so that one may then regard x as a homogeneous space for the action of g. the stabilizer of the identity coset h ∈ x is precisely the group h.
given any connected smooth manifold x and a smooth transitive action by a lie group g on x, we can construct an associated klein geometry (g, h) by fixing a basepoint x0 in x and letting h be the stabilizer subgroup of x0 in g. the group h is necessarily a closed subgroup of g and x is naturally diffeomorphic to g/h.
two klein geometries (g1, h1) and (g2, h2) are geometrically isomorphic if there is a lie group isomorphism φ : g1 → g2 so that φ(h1) = h2. in particular, if φ  is conjugation by an element g ∈ g, we see that (g, h) and (g, ghg−1) are isomorphic. the klein geometry associated to a homogeneous space x is then unique up to isomorphism (i.e. it is independent of the chosen basepoint x0).


== bundle description ==
given a lie group g and closed subgroup h, there is natural right action of h on g given by right multiplication.  this action is both free and proper. the orbits are simply the left cosets of h in g. one concludes that g has the structure of a smooth principal h-bundle over the left coset space g/h:

  
    
      
        h
        →
        g
        →
        g
        
          /
        
        h
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h\to g\to g/h.}
  


== types of klein geometries ==


=== effective geometries ===
the action of g on x = g/h need not be effective. the kernel of a klein geometry is defined to be the kernel of the action of g on x. it is given by

  
    
      
        k
        =
        {
        k
        ∈
        g
        :
        
          g
          
            −
            1
          
        
        k
        g
        ∈
        h
        
        
        ∀
        g
        ∈
        g
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=\{k\in g:g^{-1}kg\in h\;\;\forall g\in g\}.}
  the kernel k may also be described as the core of h in g (i.e. the largest subgroup of h that is normal in g). it is the group generated by all the normal subgroups of g that lie in h.
a klein geometry is said to be effective if k = 1 and locally effective if k is discrete. if (g, h) is a klein geometry with kernel k, then (g/k, h/k) is an effective klein geometry canonically associated to (g, h).


=== geometrically oriented geometries ===
a klein geometry (g, h) is geometrically oriented if g is connected. (this does not imply that g/h is an oriented manifold). if h is connected it follows that g is also connected (this is because g/h is assumed to be connected, and g → g/h is a fibration).
given any klein geometry (g, h), there is a geometrically oriented geometry canonically associated to (g, h) with the same base space g/h. this is the geometry (g0, g0 ∩ h) where g0 is the identity component of g. note that g = g0 h.


=== reductive geometries ===
a klein geometry (g, h) is said to be reductive and g/h a reductive homogeneous space if the lie algebra 
  
    
      
        
          
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {h}}}
   of h has an h-invariant complement in 
  
    
      
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
  .
