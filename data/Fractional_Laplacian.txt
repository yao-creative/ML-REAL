in mathematics, the fractional laplacian is an operator, which generalizes the notion of spatial derivatives to fractional powers.

  more concretely, the fractional laplacian can be written as a singular integral operator defined by

          ∫

                (
                y

          y
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-\delta )^{s}f(x)=c_{d,s}\int \limits _{\mathbb {r} ^{d}}{{\frac {f(x)-f(y)}{|x-y|^{d+2s}}}\,dy}}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            d

        =
        
          
            
              
                4
                
                  s
                
              
              γ
              (
              d
              
                /

              )
              
                |
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{d,s}={\frac {4^{s}\gamma (d/2+s)}{\pi ^{d/2}|\gamma (-s)|}}}
  . these two definitions, along with several other definitions, are equivalent.
some authors prefer to adopt the convention of defining the fractional laplacian of order s as 
  
    
      
        (
        −
        δ
        
          )
          
            s
            
              /
            
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-\delta )^{s/2}}
   (as defined above), where now 
  
    
      
        0
        <
        s
        <
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0<s<2}
  , so that the notion of order matches that of a (pseudo-)differential operator.
