in mathematics and physical science, spherical harmonics are special functions defined on the surface of a sphere. they are often employed in solving partial differential equations in many scientific fields.
since the spherical harmonics form a complete set of orthogonal functions and thus an orthonormal basis, each function defined on the surface of a sphere can be written as a sum of these spherical harmonics. this is similar to periodic functions defined on a circle that can be expressed as a sum of circular functions (sines and cosines) via fourier series. like the sines and cosines in fourier series, the spherical harmonics may be organized by (spatial) angular frequency, as seen in the rows of functions in the illustration on the right. further, spherical harmonics are basis functions for irreducible representations of so(3), the group of rotations in three dimensions, and thus play a central role in the group theoretic discussion of so(3).
spherical harmonics originate from solving laplace's equation in the spherical domains. functions that are solutions to laplace's equation are called harmonics. despite their name, spherical harmonics take their simplest form in cartesian coordinates, where they can be defined as homogeneous polynomials of degree

        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y,z)}
   that obey laplace's equation. the connection with spherical coordinates arises immediately if one uses the homogeneity to extract a factor of radial dependence

   specified by these angles. in this setting, they may be viewed as the angular portion of a set of solutions to laplace's equation in three dimensions, and this viewpoint is often taken as an alternative definition. notice, however, that spherical harmonics are not functions on the sphere which are harmonic with respect to the  laplace-beltrami operator  for the standard round metric on the sphere: the only harmonic functions in this sense on the sphere are the constants, since harmonic functions satisfy the  maximum principle. spherical harmonics, as functions on the sphere, are eigenfuntions of the laplace-beltrami operator (see the section higher dimensions below).

  , are known as laplace's spherical harmonics, as they were first introduced by pierre simon de laplace in 1782. these functions form an orthogonal system, and are thus basic to the expansion of a general function on the sphere as alluded to above.
spherical harmonics are important in many theoretical and practical applications, including the representation of multipole electrostatic and electromagnetic fields, electron configurations, gravitational fields, geoids, the magnetic fields of planetary bodies and stars, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. in 3d computer graphics, spherical harmonics play a role in a wide variety of topics including indirect lighting (ambient occlusion, global illumination, precomputed radiance transfer, etc.) and modelling of 3d shapes.


== history ==
spherical harmonics were first investigated in connection with the newtonian potential of newton's law of universal gravitation in three dimensions. in 1782, pierre-simon de laplace had, in his mécanique céleste, determined that the gravitational potential

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{3}\to \mathbb {r} }
   at a point x associated with a set of point masses mi located at points xi was given by

each term in the above summation is an individual newtonian potential for a point mass. just prior to that time, adrien-marie legendre had investigated the expansion of the newtonian potential in powers of r = |x| and r1 = |x1|. he discovered that if r ≤ r1 then

where γ is the angle between the vectors x and x1. the functions

          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{i}:[-1,1]\to \mathbb {r} }
   are the legendre polynomials, and they can be derived as a special case of spherical harmonics. subsequently, in his 1782 memoir, laplace investigated these coefficients using spherical coordinates to represent the angle γ between x1 and x. (see applications of legendre polynomials in physics for a more detailed analysis.)
in 1867, william thomson (lord kelvin) and peter guthrie tait introduced the solid spherical harmonics in their treatise on natural philosophy, and also first introduced the name of "spherical harmonics" for these functions. the solid harmonics were homogeneous polynomial solutions

          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{3}\to \mathbb {r} }
   of laplace's equation

by examining laplace's equation in spherical coordinates, thomson and tait recovered laplace's spherical harmonics. (see the section below, "harmonic polynomial representation".) the term "laplace's coefficients" was employed by william whewell to describe the particular system of solutions introduced along these lines, whereas others reserved this designation for the zonal spherical harmonics that had properly been introduced by laplace and legendre.
the 19th century development of fourier series made possible the solution of a wide variety of physical problems in rectangular domains, such as the solution of the heat equation and wave equation. this could be achieved by expansion of functions in series of trigonometric functions. whereas the trigonometric functions in a fourier series represent the fundamental modes of vibration in a string, the spherical harmonics represent the fundamental modes of vibration of a sphere in much the same way. many aspects of the theory of fourier series could be generalized by taking expansions in spherical harmonics rather than trigonometric functions. moreover, analogous to how trigonometric functions can equivalently be written as complex exponentials, spherical harmonics also possessed an equivalent form as complex-valued functions. this was a boon for problems possessing spherical symmetry, such as those of celestial mechanics originally studied by laplace and legendre.
the prevalence of spherical harmonics already in physics set the stage for their later importance in the 20th century birth of quantum mechanics. the (complex-valued) spherical harmonics

and therefore they represent the different quantized configurations of atomic orbitals.


== laplace's spherical harmonics ==

laplace's equation imposes that the laplacian of a scalar field f is zero. (here the scalar field is understood to be complex, i.e. to correspond to a (smooth) function 
  
    
      
        f
        :

    {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {r} ^{3}\to \mathbb {c} }
  .) in spherical coordinates this is:
consider the problem of finding solutions of the form f(r, θ, φ) = r(r) y(θ, φ). by separation of variables, two differential equations result by imposing laplace's equation:

the second equation can be simplified under the assumption that y has the form y(θ, φ) = θ(θ) φ(φ). applying separation of variables again to the second equation gives way to the pair of differential equations

for some number m. a priori, m is a complex constant, but because φ must be a periodic function whose period evenly divides 2π, m is necessarily an integer and φ is a linear combination of the complex exponentials e± imφ. the solution function y(θ, φ) is regular at the poles of the sphere, where θ = 0, π. imposing this regularity in the solution θ of the second equation at the boundary points of the domain is a sturm–liouville problem that forces the parameter λ to be of the form λ = ℓ (ℓ + 1) for some non-negative integer with ℓ ≥ |m|; this is also explained below in terms of the orbital angular momentum. furthermore, a change of variables t = cos θ transforms this equation into the legendre equation, whose solution is a multiple of the associated legendre polynomial pmℓ(cos θ) . finally, the equation for r has solutions of the form r(r) = a rℓ + b r−ℓ − 1; requiring the solution to be regular throughout r3 forces b = 0.here the solution was assumed to have the special form y(θ, φ) = θ(θ) φ(φ). for a given value of ℓ, there are 2ℓ + 1 independent solutions of this form, one for each integer m with −ℓ ≤ m ≤ ℓ. these angular solutions

=== orbital angular momentum ===
in quantum mechanics, laplace's spherical harmonics are understood in terms of the orbital angular momentum
the ħ is conventional in quantum mechanics; it is convenient to work in units in which ħ = 1. the spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the square of the orbital angular momentum

laplace's spherical harmonics are the joint eigenfunctions of the square of the orbital angular momentum and the generator of rotations about the azimuthal axis:

these operators commute, and are densely defined self-adjoint operators on the weighted hilbert space of functions f square-integrable with respect to the normal distribution as the weight function on r3:

furthermore, l2 is a positive operator.
if y is a joint eigenfunction of l2 and lz, then by definition

for some real numbers m and λ. here m must in fact be an integer, for y must be periodic in the coordinate φ with period a number that evenly divides 2π. furthermore, since

and each of lx, ly, lz are self-adjoint, it follows that λ ≥ m2.
denote this joint eigenspace by eλ,m, and define the raising and lowering operators by

then l+ and l− commute with l2, and the lie algebra generated by l+, l−, lz is the special linear lie algebra of order 2, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              s
              l

        (
        
          c
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {sl}}_{2}(\mathbb {c} )}
  , with commutation relations

thus l+ : eλ,m → eλ,m+1 (it is a "raising operator") and l− : eλ,m → eλ,m−1 (it is a "lowering operator"). in particular, lk+ : eλ,m → eλ,m+k must be zero for k sufficiently large, because the inequality λ ≥ m2 must hold in each of the nontrivial joint eigenspaces. let y ∈ eλ,m be a nonzero joint eigenfunction, and let k be the least integer such that

then, since

it follows that

thus λ = ℓ(ℓ + 1) for the positive integer ℓ = m + k.

   is harmonic if

where

        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
  , we define

for example, when

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} _{1}}
   is just the 3-dimensional space of all linear functions 
  
    
      
        
          
            r

          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{3}\to \mathbb {c} }
  , since any such function is automatically harmonic. meanwhile, when 
  
    
      
        ℓ
        =
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell =2}
  , we have a 5-dimensional space:

for any 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
  , the space 
  
    
      
        
          
            h
          
          
            ℓ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {h} _{\ell }}
   of spherical harmonics of degree 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
   is just the space of restrictions to the sphere 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{2}}
   of the elements of 
  
    
      
        
          
            a
          
          
            ℓ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} _{\ell }}
  . as suggested in the introduction, this perspective is presumably the origin of the term "spherical harmonic" (i.e., the restriction to the sphere of a harmonic function).
for example, for any 
  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {c} }
   the formula

defines a homogeneous polynomial of degree 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
   with domain and codomain 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            3
          
        
        →
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{3}\to \mathbb {c} }
  , which happens to be independent of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{3}}
  . this polynomial is easily seen to be harmonic. if we write 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   in spherical coordinates 
  
    
      
        (
        r
        ,
        θ
        ,
        ϕ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (r,\theta ,\phi )}
   and then restrict to 
  
    
      
        r
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=1}
  , we obtain

which can be rewritten as

after using the formula for the associated legendre polynomial 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            ℓ
          
          
            ℓ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\ell }^{\ell }}
  , we may recognize this as the formula for the spherical harmonic 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            ℓ

        )

== conventions ==


=== orthogonality and normalization ===
several different normalizations are in common use for the laplace spherical harmonic functions 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            2
          
        
        →
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{2}\to \mathbb {c} }
  . throughout the section, we use the standard convention that for 
  
    
      
        m
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m>0}
   (see associated legendre polynomials)

which is the natural normalization given by rodrigues' formula.
in acoustics, the laplace spherical harmonics are generally defined as (this is the convention used in this article)

while in quantum mechanics:
where 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            ℓ
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\ell }^{m}}
   are associated legendre polynomials without the condon–shortley phase (to avoid counting the phase twice).
in both definitions, the spherical harmonics are orthonormal

where δij is the kronecker delta and dω = sin(θ) dφ dθ. this normalization is used in quantum mechanics because it ensures that probability is normalized, i.e.,

the disciplines of geodesy and spectral analysis use

which possess unit power

the magnetics community, in contrast, uses schmidt semi-normalized harmonics

which have the normalization

in quantum mechanics this normalization is sometimes used as well, and is named racah's normalization after giulio racah.
it can be shown that all of the above normalized spherical harmonic functions satisfy

where the superscript * denotes complex conjugation. alternatively, this equation follows from the relation of the spherical harmonic functions with the wigner d-matrix.


=== condon–shortley phase ===
one source of confusion with the definition of the spherical harmonic functions concerns a phase factor of (−1)m, commonly referred to as the condon–shortley phase in the quantum mechanical literature. in the quantum mechanics community, it is common practice to either include this phase factor in the definition of the associated legendre polynomials, or to append it to the definition of the spherical harmonic functions. there is no requirement to use the condon–shortley phase in the definition of the spherical harmonic functions, but including it can simplify some quantum mechanical operations, especially the application of raising and lowering operators. the geodesy and magnetics communities never include the condon–shortley phase factor in their definitions of the spherical harmonic functions nor in the ones of the associated legendre polynomials.


=== real form ===
a real basis of spherical harmonics

          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y_{\ell m}:s^{2}\to \mathbb {r} }
   can be defined in terms of their complex analogues 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            ℓ

          r

   are sometimes known as tesseral spherical harmonics. these functions have the same orthonormality properties as the complex ones

   above. the real spherical harmonics

    {\displaystyle y_{\ell m}}
   with m > 0 are said to be of cosine type, and those with m < 0 of sine type. the reason for this can be seen by writing the functions in terms of the legendre polynomials as

the same sine and cosine factors can be also seen in the following subsection that deals with the cartesian representation.
see here for a list of real spherical harmonics up to and including 
  
    
      
        ℓ
        =
        4
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell =4}
  , which can be seen to be consistent with the output of the equations above.


==== use in quantum chemistry ====
as is known from the analytic solutions for the hydrogen atom, the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the wave function are spherical harmonics. however, the solutions of the non-relativistic schrödinger equation without magnetic terms can be made real. this is why the real forms are extensively used in basis functions for quantum chemistry, as the programs don't then need to use complex algebra. here, it is important to note that the real functions span the same space as the complex ones would.
for example, as can be seen from the table of spherical harmonics, the usual p functions (
  
    
      
        ℓ
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell =1}
  ) are complex and mix axis directions, but the real versions are essentially just x, y, and z.


== spherical harmonics in cartesian form ==

in naming this generating function after herglotz, we follow courant & hilbert 1962, §vii.7, who credit unpublished notes by him for its discovery.
essentially all the properties of the spherical harmonics can be derived from this generating function. an immediate benefit of this definition is that if the vector

        θ
        =
        0

    {\displaystyle m=0}
   vanish: 


== symmetry properties ==
the spherical harmonics have deep and consequential properties under the operations of spatial inversion (parity) and rotation.


=== parity ===

the spherical harmonics have definite parity. that is, they are either even or odd with respect to inversion about the origin. inversion is represented by the operator 
  
    
      
        p
        ψ
        (
        
          r
        
        )
        =
        ψ
        (
        −
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\psi (\mathbf {r} )=\psi (-\mathbf {r} )}
  . then, as can be seen in many ways (perhaps most simply from the herglotz generating function), with 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
   being a unit vector,

in terms of the spherical angles, parity transforms a point with coordinates 
  
    
      
        {
        θ
        ,
        ϕ
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\theta ,\phi \}}
   to 
  
    
      
        {
        π
        −
        θ
        ,
        π
        +
        ϕ
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\pi -\theta ,\pi +\phi \}}
  . the statement of the parity of spherical harmonics is then

(this can be seen as follows: the associated legendre polynomials gives (−1)ℓ+m and from the exponential function we have (−1)m, giving together for the spherical harmonics a parity of (−1)ℓ.)
parity continues to hold for real spherical harmonics, and for spherical harmonics in higher dimensions: applying a point reflection to a spherical harmonic of degree ℓ changes the sign by a factor of (−1)ℓ.


=== rotations ===

consider a rotation 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {r}}}
   about the origin that sends the unit vector 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
   to 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} '}
  . under this operation, a spherical harmonic of degree 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
   and order 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   transforms into a linear combination of spherical harmonics of the same degree. that is,

where 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            m
            
              m
              ′
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{mm'}}
   is a matrix of order 
  
    
      
        (
        2
        ℓ
        +
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (2\ell +1)}
   that depends on the rotation 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {r}}}
  . however, this is not the standard way of expressing this property. in the standard way one writes,

where 
  
    
      
        
          d
          
            m

            ℓ
            )

          )

    {\displaystyle d_{mm'}^{(\ell )}({\mathcal {r}})^{*}}
   is the complex conjugate of an element of the wigner d-matrix. in particular when 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} '}
   is a 
  
    
      
        
          ϕ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi _{0}}
   rotation of the azimuth we get the identity,

the rotational behavior of the spherical harmonics is perhaps their quintessential feature from the viewpoint of group theory. the

            ℓ

  's of degree 
  
    
      
        ℓ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell }
   provide a basis set of functions for the irreducible representation of the group so(3) of dimension 
  
    
      
        (
        2
        ℓ
        +
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (2\ell +1)}
  . many facts about spherical harmonics (such as the addition theorem) that are proved laboriously using the methods of analysis acquire simpler proofs and deeper significance using the methods of symmetry.

    {\displaystyle f:s^{2}\to \mathbb {c} }
   can thus be expanded as a linear combination of these:

this expansion holds in the sense of mean-square convergence — convergence in l2 of the sphere — which is to say that

the expansion coefficients are the analogs of fourier coefficients, and can be obtained by multiplying the above equation by the complex conjugate of a spherical harmonic, integrating over the solid angle ω, and utilizing the above orthogonality relationships. this is justified rigorously by basic hilbert space theory. for the case of orthonormalized harmonics, this gives:

if the coefficients decay in ℓ sufficiently rapidly — for instance, exponentially — then the series also converges uniformly to f.

== harmonic tensors ==


=== formula ===
as a rule, harmonic functions are useful in theoretical physics to consider fields in the far field when the distance from charges is much farther than the size of their location. in this case, the radius r is constant and coordinates (θ,φ) are convenient to use. theoretical physics considers many problems when a solution of laplace's equation is needed as a function of сartesian coordinates. at the same time, it is important to get an invariant form of solutions relative to the rotation of space or, generally speaking, relative to group transformations.
the simplest tensor solutions – dipole, quadrupole and octupole potentials – are fundamental concepts of general physics:

it is easy to verify that they are the harmonic functions. the total set of tensors is defined by the taylor series of a point charge field potential for 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            0
          
        
        <
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{0}<r}
  :

where tensor 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
            i
          
        
        …
        
          x
          
            0
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0i}\ldots x_{0k}}
   is denoted by symbol 
  
    
      
        ⊗
        
          
            
              r
              
                0
              
            
          
          
            l
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \otimes {\boldsymbol {r_{0}}}^{l}}
   and contraction of the tensors is in the brackets [...].
therefore, the tensor 
  
    
      
        
          
            t
          
          
            (
            l
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {t}}^{(l)}}
   is defined by the 
  
    
      
        l
      
    
    {\displaystyle l}
  -th tensor derivative:

james clerk maxwell used similar considerations without tensors naturally. e. w. hobson analysed maxwell's method as well.
one can see from the equation the following properties that repeat mainly those of solid and spherical functions.

the tensor is the harmonic polynomial i. e. 
  
    
      
        δ
        
          
            t

            l
            )
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta {\boldsymbol {t}}^{(l)}=0}
  .
the trace over each pair of indices is zero, as far as 
  
    
      
        δ
        
          
            1
            r
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\textstyle \delta {\frac {1}{r}}=0}
  .
the tensor is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 
  
    
      
        l
      
    
    {\displaystyle l}
   i.e. summed degree of variables x, y, z of each item is equal to 
  
    
      
        l
      
    
    {\displaystyle l}
  .
the tensor has invariant form under rotations of variables x,y,z i.e. of vector 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
  .
the total set of potentials 
  
    
      
        
          
            t
          
          
            (
            l
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} ^{(l)}}
   is complete.

            (
            l
            )
          
        
        (
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} ^{(l)}(\mathbf {r} )}
   with a tensor 
  
    
      
        ⊗
        
          
            ρ

    {\displaystyle \otimes {\boldsymbol {\rho }}^{l}}
   is proportional to contraction of two harmonic potentials: the formula for a harmonic invariant tensor was found in paper. a detailed description is given in the monograph. 4-d harmonic tensors are important in fock symmetry found in quantum the coulomb problem.
the formula contains products of tensors 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        …
        
          x
          
            k
          
        
        =
        
          ⊗
        
        
          r
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}\ldots x_{k}=\mathbf {\otimes } r^{m}}
   and kronecker symbols 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            i
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta _{ik}}
  :

the number of kronecker symbols is increased by two in the product of each following item when the range of tensors 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        …
        
          x
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}\dots x_{k}}
   is reduced by two accordingly. the operation 
  
    
      
        
          ⟨
          ⋅
          ⟩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\langle \cdot \right\rangle }
   symmetrizes a tensor by means of summing all independent permutations of indices. particularly, each 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            i
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta _{ik}}
   does not need to be transformed into 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            k
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta _{ki}}
   and tensors 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        
          x
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}x_{k}}
   do not become 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            k
          
        
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{k}x_{i}}
  .
these tensors are convenient to substitute into laplace's equation:

the last relation is euler's formula for homogeneous polynomials. the laplace operator 
  
    
      
        δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta }
   does not affect the index symmetry of tensors. the two relations allow substitution of a tensor into laplace's equation to check directly that the tensor is a harmonic function:


=== simplified moments ===
the last property is important for theoretical physics for the following reason. potential of charges outside of their location is integral to be equal to the sum of multipole potentials:

where 
  
    
      
        
          f
        
        (
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {f}(\mathbf {r} )}
   is the charge density. the convolution is applied to tensors in the formula naturally. integrals in the sum are called multipole moments in physics. three of them are used actively while others are applied less often as their structure (or that of spherical functions) is more complicated. nevertheless, the last property gives the way to simplify calculations in theoretical physics by using integrals with tensor 
  
    
      
        
          ⊗
        
        
          r
          
            l
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\otimes }}r^{l}}
   instead of harmonic tensor 
  
    
      
        
          
            t
          
          
            (
            l
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} ^{(l)}}
  . therefore, simplified moments give the same result and there is no need to restrict calculations for dipole, quadrupole and octupole potentials only. it is the advantage of the tensor point of view and not the only that.


=== efimov's ladder operator ===

        ψ
        −
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi -}
  functions of quantum states by means of a ladder operator. the property is occurred due to symmetry group of considered system. the vector ladder operator for the invariant harmonic states found in paper and detailed in.
for that purpose, transformation of

  , one can apply it to dipole and quadrupole tensors:

applying successively

   we get general form of invariant harmonic tensors:

commutator of the coordinate operators is zero: the property is utterly convenient for calculations.

the ladder operator is analogous for that in problem of the quantum oscillator. it generates glauber states those are created in the quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation fields. it was shown later as theoretical result that the coherent states are intrinsic for any quantum system with a group symmetry to include the rotational group.

== spectrum analysis ==


=== power spectrum in signal processing ===
the total power of a function f is defined in the signal processing literature as the integral of the function squared, divided by the area of its domain. using the orthonormality properties of the real unit-power spherical harmonic functions, it is straightforward to verify that the total power of a function defined on the unit sphere is related to its spectral coefficients by a generalization of parseval's theorem (here, the theorem is stated for schmidt semi-normalized harmonics, the relationship is slightly different for orthonormal harmonics):

where

is defined as the angular power spectrum (for schmidt semi-normalized harmonics). in a similar manner, one can define the cross-power of two functions as

where

is defined as the cross-power spectrum. if the functions f and g have a zero mean (i.e., the spectral coefficients f00 and g00 are zero), then sff(ℓ) and sfg(ℓ) represent the contributions to the function's variance and covariance for degree ℓ, respectively. it is common that the (cross-)power spectrum is well approximated by a power law of the form

when β = 0, the spectrum is "white" as each degree possesses equal power. when β < 0, the spectrum is termed "red" as there is more power at the low degrees with long wavelengths than higher degrees. finally, when β > 0, the spectrum is termed "blue". the condition on the order of growth of sff(ℓ) is related to the order of differentiability of f in the next section.


=== differentiability properties ===
one can also understand the differentiability properties of the original function f in terms of the asymptotics of sff(ℓ). in particular, if sff(ℓ) decays faster than any rational function of ℓ as ℓ → ∞, then f is infinitely differentiable. if, furthermore, sff(ℓ) decays exponentially, then f is actually real analytic on the sphere.
the general technique is to use the theory of sobolev spaces. statements relating the growth of the sff(ℓ) to differentiability are then similar to analogous results on the growth of the coefficients of fourier series. specifically, if

then f is in the sobolev space hs(s2). in particular, the sobolev embedding theorem implies that f is infinitely differentiable provided that

=== addition theorem ===
a mathematical result of considerable interest and use is called the addition theorem for spherical harmonics. given two vectors r and r′, with spherical coordinates

        r

        ,
        
          θ
          ′
        
        ,

    {\displaystyle (r',\theta ',\varphi ')}
  , respectively, the angle 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   between them is given by the relation

in which the role of the trigonometric functions appearing on the right-hand side is played by the spherical harmonics and that of the left-hand side is played by the legendre polynomials.
the addition theorem states
where pℓ is the legendre polynomial of degree ℓ. this expression is valid for both real and complex harmonics. the result can be proven analytically, using the properties of the poisson kernel in the unit ball, or geometrically by applying a rotation to the vector y so that it points along the z-axis, and then directly calculating the right-hand side.in particular, when x = y, this gives unsöld's theorem
which generalizes the identity cos2θ + sin2θ = 1 to two dimensions.
in the expansion (1), the left-hand side pℓ(x⋅y) is a constant multiple of the degree ℓ zonal spherical harmonic. from this perspective, one has the following generalization to higher dimensions. let yj be an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the space hℓ of degree ℓ spherical harmonics on the n-sphere. then 
  
    
      
        
          z

            (
            ℓ
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{\mathbf {x} }^{(\ell )}}
  , the degree ℓ zonal harmonic corresponding to the unit vector x, decomposes as
furthermore, the zonal harmonic 
  
    
      
        
          z

            (
            ℓ
            )
          
        
        (
        
          
            y
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{\mathbf {x} }^{(\ell )}({\mathbf {y} })}
   is given as a constant multiple of the appropriate gegenbauer polynomial:

combining (2) and (3) gives (1) in dimension n = 2 when x and y are represented in spherical coordinates. finally, evaluating at x = y gives the functional identity

where ωn−1 is the volume of the (n−1)-sphere.


=== contraction rule ===

    {\displaystyle c}
   and 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   that result in non-zero terms in this sum are determined by the selection rules for the 3j-symbols.


=== clebsch–gordan coefficients ===

the clebsch–gordan coefficients are the coefficients appearing in the expansion of the product of two spherical harmonics in terms of spherical harmonics themselves. a variety of techniques are available for doing essentially the same calculation, including the wigner 3-jm symbol, the racah coefficients, and the slater integrals. abstractly, the clebsch–gordan coefficients express the tensor product of two irreducible representations of the rotation group as a sum of irreducible representations: suitably normalized, the coefficients are then the multiplicities.

  , the real and imaginary components of the associated legendre polynomials each possess ℓ−|m| zeros, each giving rise to a nodal 'line of latitude'. on the other hand, considering

  , the trigonometric sin and cos functions possess 2|m| zeros, each of which gives rise to a nodal 'line of longitude'.
when the spherical harmonic order m is zero (upper-left in the figure), the spherical harmonic functions do not depend upon longitude, and are referred to as zonal. such spherical harmonics are a special case of zonal spherical functions. when ℓ = |m| (bottom-right in the figure), there are no zero crossings in latitude, and the functions are referred to as sectoral. for the other cases, the functions checker the sphere, and they are referred to as tesseral.
more general spherical harmonics of degree ℓ are not necessarily those of the laplace basis

   must be trace free on every pair of indices. thus as an irreducible representation of so(3), hℓ is isomorphic to the space of traceless symmetric tensors of degree ℓ.
more generally, the analogous statements hold in higher dimensions: the space hℓ of spherical harmonics on the n-sphere is the irreducible representation of so(n+1) corresponding to the traceless symmetric ℓ-tensors. however, whereas every irreducible tensor representation of so(2) and so(3) is of this kind, the special orthogonal groups in higher dimensions have additional irreducible representations that do not arise in this manner.
the special orthogonal groups have additional spin representations that are not tensor representations, and are typically not spherical harmonics. an exception are the spin representation of so(3): strictly speaking these are representations of the double cover su(2) of so(3). in turn, su(2) is identified with the group of unit quaternions, and so coincides with the 3-sphere. the spaces of spherical harmonics on the 3-sphere are certain spin representations of so(3), with respect to the action by quaternionic multiplication.


== connection with hemispherical harmonics ==
spherical harmonics can be separated into two set of functions. one is hemispherical functions (hsh), orthogonal and complete on hemisphere. another is complementary hemispherical harmonics (chsh).


=== generalizations ===
the angle-preserving symmetries of the two-sphere are described by the group of möbius transformations psl(2,c). with respect to this group, the sphere is equivalent to the usual riemann sphere. the group psl(2,c) is isomorphic to the (proper) lorentz group, and its action on the two-sphere agrees with the action of the lorentz group on the celestial sphere in minkowski space. the analog of the spherical harmonics for the lorentz group is given by the hypergeometric series; furthermore, the spherical harmonics can be re-expressed in terms of the hypergeometric series, as so(3) = psu(2) is a subgroup of psl(2,c).
more generally, hypergeometric series can be generalized to describe the symmetries of any symmetric space; in particular, hypergeometric series can be developed for any lie group.
