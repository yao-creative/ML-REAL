in homological algebra and algebraic topology, a spectral sequence is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations.  spectral sequences are a generalization of exact sequences, and since their introduction by jean leray (1946a, 1946b), they have become important computational tools, particularly in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and homological algebra.


== discovery and motivation ==
motivated by problems in algebraic topology, jean leray introduced the notion of a sheaf and found himself faced with the problem of computing sheaf cohomology. to compute sheaf cohomology, leray introduced a computational technique now known as the leray spectral sequence. this gave a relation between cohomology groups of a sheaf and cohomology groups of the pushforward of the sheaf. the relation involved an infinite process. leray found that the cohomology groups of the pushforward formed a natural chain complex, so that he could take the cohomology of the cohomology. this was still not the cohomology of the original sheaf, but it was one step closer in a sense. the cohomology of the cohomology again formed a chain complex, and its cohomology formed a chain complex, and so on. the limit of this infinite process was essentially the same as the cohomology groups of the original sheaf.
it was soon realized that leray's computational technique was an example of a more general phenomenon. spectral sequences were found in diverse situations, and they gave intricate relationships among homology and cohomology groups coming from geometric situations such as fibrations and from algebraic situations involving derived functors. while their theoretical importance has decreased since the introduction of derived categories, they are still the most effective computational tool available. this is true even when many of the terms of the spectral sequence are incalculable.
unfortunately, because of the large amount of information carried in spectral sequences, they are difficult to grasp. this information is usually contained in a rank three lattice of abelian groups or modules. the easiest cases to deal with are those in which the spectral sequence eventually collapses, meaning that going out further in the sequence produces no new information. even when this does not happen, it is often possible to get useful information from a spectral sequence by various tricks.

=== bigraded spectral sequence ===
in reality spectral sequences mostly occur in the category of doubly graded modules over a ring r (or doubly graded sheaves of modules over a sheaf of rings), i.e. every sheet is a bigraded r-module 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
          
        
        =
        
          ⨁
          
            p
            ,
            q
            ∈
            
              
                z
              
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        
          e
          
            r
          
          
            p
            ,
            q
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\textstyle e_{r}=\bigoplus _{p,q\in \mathbb {z} ^{2}}e_{r}^{p,q}.}

==== spectral sequence from a chain complex ====
the most elementary example in the ungraded situation is a chain complex c•. an object c• in an abelian category of chain complexes naturally comes with a differential d.  let r0 = 0, and let e0 be c•. this forces e1 to be the complex h(c•): at the i'th location this is the i'th homology group of c•. the only natural differential on this new complex is the zero map, so we let d1 = 0. this forces 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{2}}
   to equal 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{1}}
  , and again our only natural differential is the zero map. putting the zero differential on all the rest of our sheets gives a spectral sequence whose terms are:

e0 = c•
er = h(c•) for all r ≥ 1.the terms of this spectral sequence stabilize at the first sheet because its only nontrivial differential was on the zeroth sheet. consequently, we can get no more information at later steps. usually, to get useful information from later sheets, we need extra structure on the 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r}}
  .


== visualization ==

a doubly graded spectral sequence has a tremendous amount of data to keep track of, but there is a common visualization technique which makes the structure of the spectral sequence clearer. we have three indices, r, p, and q. an object 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r}}
   can be seen as the 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            t
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r^{th}}
   checkered page of a book. on these sheets, we will take p to be the horizontal direction and q to be the vertical direction. at each lattice point we have the object 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
          
          
            p
            ,
            q
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r}^{p,q}}
  . now turning to the next page means taking homology, that is the 
  
    
      
        (
        r
        +
        1
        
          )
          
            t
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (r+1)^{th}}
   page is a subquotient of the 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            t
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r^{th}}
   page. the total degree n = p + q runs diagonally, northwest to southeast, across each sheet. in the homological case, the differentials have bidegree (−r, r − 1), so they decrease n by one. in the cohomological case, n is increased by one. the differentials change their direction with each turn with respect to r.

the red arrows demonstrate the case of a first quadrant sequence (see example below), where only the objects of the first quadrant are non-zero. while turning pages, either the domain or the codomain of all the differentials become zero.

=== multiplicative structure ===
a cup product gives a ring structure to a cohomology group, turning it into a cohomology ring. thus, it is natural to consider a spectral sequence with a ring structure as well. let 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
          
          
            p
            ,
            q
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r}^{p,q}}
   be a spectral sequence of cohomological type.  we say it has multiplicative structure if (i) 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r}}
   are (doubly graded) differential graded algebras and (ii) the multiplication on 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
            +
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r+1}}
   is induced by that on 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r}}
   via passage to cohomology.
a typical example is the cohomological serre spectral sequence for a fibration 
  
    
      
        f
        →
        e
        →
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\to e\to b}
  , when the coefficient group is a ring r. it has the multiplicative structure induced by the cup products of fibre and base on the 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{2}}
  -page. however, in general the limiting term 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{\infty }}
   is not isomorphic as a graded algebra to h(e; r). the multiplicative structure can be very useful for calculating differentials on the sequence.


== constructions of spectral sequences ==
spectral sequences can be constructed by various ways. in algebraic topology, an exact couple is perhaps the most common tool for the construction. in algebraic geometry, spectral sequences are usually constructed from filtrations of cochain complexes.


=== spectral sequence of an exact couple ===

 
the most powerful technique for the construction of spectral sequences is william massey's method of exact couples.  exact couples are particularly common in algebraic topology, where there are many spectral sequences for which no other construction is known. in fact, all known spectral sequences can be constructed using exact couples. despite this they are unpopular in abstract algebra, where most spectral sequences come from filtered complexes.
to define exact couples, we begin again with an abelian category. as before, in practice this is usually the category of doubly graded modules over a ring.  an exact couple is a pair of objects (a, c), together with three homomorphisms between these objects: f : a → a, g : a → c and h : c → a subject to certain exactness conditions:

image f = kernel g
image g = kernel h
image h = kernel fwe will abbreviate this data by (a, c, f, g, h).  exact couples are usually depicted as triangles.  we will see that c corresponds to the e0 term of the spectral sequence and that a is some auxiliary data.
to pass to the next sheet of the spectral sequence, we will form the derived couple.  we set:

d = g o h
a' = f(a)
c' = ker d / im d
f' = f|a', the restriction of f to a'
h' : c' → a' is induced by h.  it is straightforward to see that h induces such a map.
g' : a' → c' is defined on elements as follows: for each a in a', write a as f(b) for some b in a.  g'(a) is defined to be the image of g(b) in c'. in general, g' can be constructed using one of the embedding theorems for abelian categories.from here it is straightforward to check that (a', c', f', g', h') is an exact couple. c' corresponds to the e1 term of the spectral sequence. we can iterate this procedure to get exact couples (a(n), c(n), f(n), g(n), h(n)).
in order to construct a spectral sequence, let en be c(n) and dn be g(n) o h(n).

the filtration is useful because it gives a measure of nearness to zero: as p increases, 
  
    
      
        
          f

    {\textstyle f^{p}c^{\bullet }}
    gets closer and closer to zero.  we will construct a spectral sequence from this filtration where coboundaries and cocycles in later sheets get closer and closer to coboundaries and cocycles in the original complex.  this spectral sequence is doubly graded by the filtration degree p and the complementary degree q = n − p.

            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r}}
   and verify that it leads to homology isomorphic to

    {\displaystyle d_{r}^{p,q}:e_{r}^{p,q}\rightarrow e_{r}^{p+r,q-r+1}}
  is defined by restricting the original differential

    {\displaystyle d}
   defined on

  . it is straightforward to check that the homology of 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r}}
   with respect to this differential is 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            r
            +
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{r+1}}
  , so this gives a spectral sequence. unfortunately, the differential is not very explicit. determining differentials or finding ways to work around them is one of the main challenges to successfully applying a spectral sequence.

=== the spectral sequence of a double complex ===
another common spectral sequence is the spectral sequence of a double complex. a double complex is a collection of objects ci,j for all integers i and j together with two differentials, d i and d ii.  d i is assumed to decrease i, and d ii is assumed to decrease j. furthermore, we assume that the differentials anticommute, so that d i d ii + d ii d i = 0. our goal is to compare the iterated homologies

        (
        
          h

            i
            i

    {\displaystyle h_{i}^{i}(h_{j}^{ii}(c_{\bullet ,\bullet }))}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            j

            i

            i

        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{j}^{ii}(h_{i}^{i}(c_{\bullet ,\bullet }))}
  . we will do this by filtering our double complex in two different ways.  here are our filtrations:

  to get a spectral sequence, we will reduce to the previous example. we define the total complex t(c•,•) to be the complex whose n'th term is 
  
    
      
        
          ⨁

  where n = p + q.
to find the e1 term, we need to determine d i + d ii on e0. notice that the differential must have degree −1 with respect to n, so we get a map

  consequently, the differential on e0 is the map cp,q → cp,q−1 induced by d i + d ii.  but  d i has the wrong degree to induce such a map, so d i must be zero on e0. that means the differential is exactly d ii, so we get

  because e1 was exactly the homology with respect to d ii, d ii is zero on e1. consequently, we get

        (
        
          h

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {}^{i}e_{p,q}^{2}=h_{p}^{i}(h_{q}^{ii}(c_{\bullet ,\bullet })).}
  using the other filtration gives us a different spectral sequence with a similar e2 term:

        =
        
          h
          
            q
          
          
            i
            i
          
        
        (
        
          h
          
            p
          
          
            i
          
        
        (
        
          c
          
            ∙
            ,
            ∙

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {}^{ii}e_{p,q}^{2}=h_{q}^{ii}(h_{p}^{i}(c_{\bullet ,\bullet })).}
  what remains is to find a relationship between these two spectral sequences. it will turn out that as r increases, the two sequences will become similar enough to allow useful comparisons.

          e
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{\infty }}
   is the same as 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{1}}
  .
the five-term exact sequence of a spectral sequence relates certain low-degree terms and e∞ terms.

   is a natural candidate for the abutment of this spectral sequence. convergence is not automatic, but happens in many cases. in particular, if the filtration is finite and consists of exactly r nontrivial steps, then the spectral sequence degenerates after the rth sheet. convergence also occurs if the complex and the filtration are both bounded below or both bounded above.

==== long exact sequences ====
using the spectral sequence of a filtered complex, we can derive the existence of long exact sequences. choose a short exact sequence of cochain complexes 0 → a• → b• → c• → 0, and call the first map f• : a• → b•. we get natural maps of homology objects hn(a•) → hn(b•) → hn(c•), and we know that this is exact in the middle. we will use the spectral sequence of a filtered complex to find the connecting homomorphism and to prove that the resulting sequence is exact.to start, we filter b•:

  it remains to show that this sequence is exact at the a and c spots.  notice that this spectral sequence degenerates at the e2 term because the differentials have bidegree (2, −1). consequently, the e2 term is the same as the e∞ term:

  the former gives exactness at the c spot, and the latter gives exactness at the a spot.

==== commutativity of tor ====
let r be a ring, let m be a right r-module and n a left r-module. recall that the derived functors of the tensor product are denoted tor. tor is defined using a projective resolution of its first argument. however, it turns out that 
  
    
      
        
          tor
          
            i
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        m
        ,
        n
        )
        =
        
          tor
          
            i
          
        
        ⁡

        n

        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {tor} _{i}(m,n)=\operatorname {tor} _{i}(n,m)}
  . while this can be verified without a spectral sequence, it is very easy with spectral sequences.
