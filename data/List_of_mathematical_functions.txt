in mathematics, some functions or groups of functions are important enough to deserve their own names. this is a listing of articles which explain some of these functions in more detail. there is a large theory of special functions which developed out of statistics and mathematical physics. a modern, abstract point of view contrasts large function spaces, which are infinite-dimensional and within which most functions are 'anonymous', with special functions picked out by properties such as symmetry, or relationship to harmonic analysis and group representations.

== elementary functions ==
elementary functions are functions built from basic operations (e.g. addition, exponentials, logarithms...)


=== algebraic functions ===
algebraic functions are functions that can be expressed as the solution of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients.

polynomials: can be generated solely by addition, multiplication, and raising to the power of a positive integer.
constant function: polynomial of degree zero, graph is a horizontal straight line
linear function: first degree polynomial, graph is a straight line.
quadratic function: second degree polynomial, graph is a parabola.
cubic function: third degree polynomial.
quartic function: fourth degree polynomial.
quintic function: fifth degree polynomial.
sextic function: sixth degree polynomial.
rational functions: a ratio of two polynomials.
nth root
square root: yields a number whose square is the given one.
cube root: yields a number whose cube is the given one.


=== elementary transcendental functions ===
transcendental functions are functions that are not algebraic.

exponential function: raises a fixed number to a variable power.
hyperbolic functions: formally similar to the trigonometric functions.
logarithms: the inverses of exponential functions; useful to solve equations involving exponentials.
natural logarithm
common logarithm
binary logarithm
power functions: raise a variable number to a fixed power; also known as allometric functions; note: if the power is a rational number it is not strictly a transcendental function.
periodic functions
trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, cosecant, exsecant, excosecant, versine, coversine, vercosine, covercosine, haversine, hacoversine, havercosine, hacovercosine, etc.; used in geometry and to describe periodic phenomena. see also gudermannian function.

=== arithmetic functions ===
sigma function: sums of powers of divisors of a given natural number.
euler's totient function: number of numbers coprime to (and not bigger than) a given one.
prime-counting function:  number of primes less than or equal to a given number.
partition function:  order-independent count of ways to write a given positive integer as a sum of positive integers.
möbius μ function: sum of the nth primitive roots of unity, it depends on the prime factorization of n.

=== miscellaneous functions ===
ackermann function: in the theory of computation, a computable function that is not primitive recursive.
dirac delta function: everywhere zero except for x = 0; total integral is 1. not a function but a distribution, but sometimes informally referred to as a function, particularly by physicists and engineers.
dirichlet function: is an indicator function that matches 1 to rational numbers and 0 to irrationals. it is nowhere continuous.
thomae's function: is a function that is continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers. it is also a modification of dirichlet function and sometimes called riemann function.
kronecker delta function: is a function of two variables, usually integers, which is 1 if they are equal, and 0 otherwise.
minkowski's question mark function: derivatives vanish on the rationals.
weierstrass function: is an example of continuous function that is nowhere differentiable
