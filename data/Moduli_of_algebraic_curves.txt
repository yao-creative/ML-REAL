in algebraic geometry, a moduli space of (algebraic) curves  is a geometric space (typically a scheme or an algebraic stack) whose points represent isomorphism classes of algebraic curves.  it is thus a special case of a moduli space. depending on the restrictions applied to the classes of algebraic curves considered, the corresponding moduli problem and the moduli space is different. one also distinguishes between  fine and coarse moduli spaces for the same moduli problem.
the most basic problem is that of moduli of smooth complete curves of a fixed genus. over the field of complex numbers these correspond precisely to compact riemann surfaces of the given genus, for which bernhard riemann proved the first results about moduli spaces, in particular their dimensions ("number of parameters on which the complex structure depends").

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {m}}_{g}}
   classifies families of smooth projective curves, together with their isomorphisms.   when 
  
    
      
        g
        >
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle g>1}
  , this stack may be compactified by adding new "boundary" points which correspond to stable nodal curves (together with their isomorphisms).  a curve is stable if it is complete, connected, has no singularities other than double points, and has only a finite group of automorphisms.  the resulting stack is denoted

  .  in lower genus, one must account for the presence of smooth families of automorphisms, by subtracting their number.  there is exactly one complex curve of genus zero, the riemann sphere, and its group of isomorphisms is pgl(2).  hence the dimension of

  likewise, in genus 1, there is a one-dimensional space of curves, but every such curve has a one-dimensional group of automorphisms.  hence, the stack

=== properness ===
properness, or compactness for orbifolds, follows from a theorem on stable reduction on curves. this can be found using a theorem of grothendieck regarding the stable reduction of abelian varieties, and showing its equivalence to the stable reduction of curves.section 5.2


=== coarse moduli spaces ===
one can also consider the coarse moduli spaces representing isomorphism classes of smooth or stable curves.  these coarse moduli spaces were actually studied before the notion of moduli stack was introduced.  in fact, the idea of a moduli stack  was introduced by deligne and mumford  in an attempt to prove the projectivity of the coarse moduli spaces.  in recent years, it has become apparent that the stack of curves is actually the more fundamental object.
the coarse moduli spaces have the same dimension as the stacks when 
  
    
      
        g
        >
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle g>1}
  ; however, in genus zero the coarse moduli space has dimension zero, and in genus one, it has dimension one.

=== genus 3 ===
this is the first moduli space of curves which has both a hyperelliptic locus and a non-hyperelliptic locus. the non-hyperelliptic curves are all given by plane curves of degree 4 (using the genus degree formula), which are parameterized by the smooth locus in the hilbert scheme of hypersurfaces

=== unirationality conjecture ===
in all of the previous cases, the moduli spaces can be found to be unirational, meaning there exists a dominant rational morphism
  
    
      
        
          
            p

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {p} ^{n}-->{\mathcal {m}}_{g}}
  and it was long expected this would be true in all genera. in fact, severi had proved this to be true for genera up to 
  
    
      
        10
      
    
    {\displaystyle 10}
  . it turns out though for genus 
  
    
      
        g
        ≥
        23
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\geq 23}
   all such moduli spaces are of general type, meaning they are not unirational. they accomplished this by studying the kodaira dimension of the coarse moduli spaces

        g
        ≥
        23
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\geq 23}
  .  in fact, for 
  
    
      
        g
        >
        23
      
    
    {\displaystyle g>23}
