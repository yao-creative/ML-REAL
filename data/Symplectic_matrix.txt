=== generators for symplectic matrices ===
every symplectic matrix has determinant 
  
    
      
        +

    {\displaystyle +1}
  , and the

    {\displaystyle 2n\times 2n}
   symplectic matrices with real entries form a subgroup of the general linear group 
  
    
      
        
          g
          l
        
        (

        n
        ;

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {gl} (2n;\mathbb {r} )}
   under matrix multiplication since being symplectic is a property stable under matrix multiplication. topologically, this symplectic group is a connected noncompact real lie group of real dimension 
  
    
      
        n
        (
        2
        n
        +
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle n(2n+1)}
  , and is denoted 
  
    
      
        
          s
          p
        
        (
        2
        n
        ;
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {sp} (2n;\mathbb {r} )}
  . the symplectic group can be defined as the set of linear transformations that preserve the symplectic form of a real symplectic vector space.
this symplectic group has a distinguished set of generators, which can be used to find all possible symplectic matrices. this includes the following sets

where 
  
    
      
        
          sym
        
        (
        n
        ;
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{sym}}(n;\mathbb {r} )}
   is the set of 
  
    
      
        n
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\times n}
   symmetric matrices. then, 
  
    
      
        
          s
          p
        
        (
        2
        n
        ;
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {sp} (2n;\mathbb {r} )}
   is generated by the setp. 2
of matrices. in other words, any symplectic matrix can be constructed by multiplying matrices in 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(n)}
   and 
  
    
      
        n
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle n(n)}
   together, along with some power of 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  .


=== inverse matrix ===
every symplectic matrix is invertible with the inverse matrix given by

furthermore, the product of two symplectic matrices is, again, a symplectic matrix. this gives the set of all symplectic matrices the structure of a group. there exists a natural manifold structure on this group which makes it into a (real or complex) lie group called the symplectic group.


=== determinantal properties ===
it follows easily from the definition that the determinant of any symplectic matrix is ±1. actually, it turns out that the determinant is always +1 for any field. one way to see this is through the use of the pfaffian and the identity

since 
  
    
      
        
          m
          
            t
          
        
        ω
        m
        =
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle m^{\text{t}}\omega m=\omega }
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            pf
          
        
        (
        ω
        )
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mbox{pf}}(\omega )\neq 0}
   we have that 
  
    
      
        det
        (
        m
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \det(m)=1}
  .
when the underlying field is real or complex, one can also show this by factoring the inequality 
  
    
      
        det
        (
        
          m
          
            t
          
        
        m
        +
        i
        )
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \det(m^{\text{t}}m+i)\geq 1}
  .


=== block form of symplectic matrices ===
suppose ω is given in the standard form and let 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   be a 
  
    
      
        2
        n
        ×
        2
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2n\times 2n}
   block matrix given by

where 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
        ,
        c
        ,
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,b,c,d}
   are 
  
    
      
        n
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\times n}
   matrices. the condition for 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   to be symplectic is equivalent to the two following equivalent conditions
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            t
          
        
        c
        ,
        
          b
          
            t
          
        
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{\text{t}}c,b^{\text{t}}d}
   symmetric, and 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            t
          
        
        d
        −
        
          c
          
            t
          
        
        b
        =
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{\text{t}}d-c^{\text{t}}b=i}
  
  
    
      
        a
        
          b
          
            t
          
        
        ,
        c
        
          d
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle ab^{\text{t}},cd^{\text{t}}}
   symmetric, and 
  
    
      
        a
        
          d
          
            t
          
        
        −
        b
        
          c
          
            t
          
        
        =
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle ad^{\text{t}}-bc^{\text{t}}=i}
  when 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=1}
   these conditions reduce to the single condition 
  
    
      
        det
        (
        m
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \det(m)=1}
  . thus a 
  
    
      
        2
        ×
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\times 2}
   matrix is symplectic iff it has unit determinant.

with

   in standard form, the inverse of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is given by

the group has dimension

        +
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle n(2n+1)}
  . this can be seen by noting that 
  
    
      
        (
        
          m

        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle (m^{\text{t}}\omega m)^{\text{t}}=-m^{\text{t}}\omega m}

== symplectic transformations ==
in the abstract formulation of linear algebra, matrices are replaced with linear transformations of finite-dimensional vector spaces. the abstract analog of a symplectic matrix is a symplectic transformation of a symplectic vector space. briefly, a symplectic vector space 
  
    
      
        (
        v
        ,
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (v,\omega )}
   is a 
  
    
      
        2
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2n}
  -dimensional vector space 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   equipped with a nondegenerate, skew-symmetric bilinear form 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   called the symplectic form.
a symplectic transformation is then a linear transformation 
  
    
      
        l
        :
        v
        →
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle l:v\to v}
   which preserves 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  , i.e.

  
    
      
        ω
        (
        l
        u
        ,

        v
        )
        =
        ω
        (
        u
        ,
        v
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega (lu,lv)=\omega (u,v).}
  fixing a basis for

    {\displaystyle v}
  , 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   can be written as a matrix 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   and

    {\displaystyle l}
   as a matrix 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  . the condition that 
  
    
      
        l
      
    
    {\displaystyle l}
   be a symplectic transformation is precisely the condition that m be a symplectic matrix:

  
    
      
        
          m

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m^{\text{t}}\omega m=\omega .}
  under a change of basis, represented by a matrix a, we have

== the matrix ω ==
symplectic matrices are defined relative to a fixed nonsingular, skew-symmetric matrix 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  . as explained in the previous section, 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   can be thought of as the coordinate representation of a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form. it is a basic result in linear algebra that any two such matrices differ from each other by a change of basis.

  this choice differs from the previous one by a permutation of basis vectors.
sometimes the notation 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   is used instead of 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   for the skew-symmetric matrix. this is a particularly unfortunate choice as it leads to confusion with the notion of a complex structure, which often has the same coordinate expression as 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   but represents a very different structure. a complex structure 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   is the coordinate representation of a linear transformation that squares to

          i

        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   is the coordinate representation of a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form. one could easily choose bases in which 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   is not skew-symmetric or 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   does not square to 
  
    
      
        −
        
          i

  any real symplectic matrix can be decomposed as a product of three matrices:
 such that o and o' are both symplectic and orthogonal and d is positive-definite and diagonal. this decomposition is closely related to the singular value decomposition of a matrix and is known as an 'euler' or 'bloch-messiah' decomposition.


== complex matrices ==
if instead m is a 2n × 2n matrix with complex entries, the definition is not standard throughout the literature.  many authors  adjust the definition above to

where m* denotes the conjugate transpose of m. in this case, the determinant may not be 1, but will have absolute value 1. in the 2×2 case (n=1), m will be the product of a real symplectic matrix and a complex number of absolute value 1.
other authors  retain the definition (1) for complex matrices and call matrices satisfying (3) conjugate symplectic.


== applications ==
transformations described by symplectic matrices play an important role in quantum optics and in continuous-variable quantum information theory. for instance, symplectic matrices can be used to describe gaussian (bogoliubov) transformations of a quantum state of light. in turn, the bloch-messiah decomposition (2) means that such an arbitrary gaussian transformation can be represented as a set of two passive linear-optical interferometers (corresponding to orthogonal matrices o and o' ) intermitted by a layer of active non-linear squeezing transformations (given in terms of the matrix d). in fact, one can circumvent the need for such in-line active squeezing transformations if two-mode squeezed vacuum states are available as a prior resource only.
