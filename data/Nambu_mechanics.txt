in mathematics, nambu mechanics is a generalization of hamiltonian mechanics involving multiple hamiltonians.  recall that hamiltonian mechanics is based upon the flows generated by a smooth hamiltonian over a symplectic manifold. the flows are symplectomorphisms and hence obey liouville's theorem. this was soon generalized to flows generated by a hamiltonian over a poisson manifold.  in 1973, yoichiro nambu suggested a generalization involving nambu-poisson manifolds with more than one hamiltonian.

        f

  the generalized phase-space velocity is divergenceless, enabling liouville's theorem. the case n = 2  reduces to  a poisson manifold, and conventional hamiltonian mechanics.
for larger even n, the n−1 hamiltonians identify with the maximal number of independent invariants of motion (cf. conserved quantity) characterizing a superintegrable system which evolves in n-dimensional phase space. such systems are also describable by conventional hamiltonian dynamics; but their description in the framework of nambu mechanics is substantially more elegant and intuitive, as all invariants enjoy the same geometrical status as the hamiltonian: the trajectory in phase space is the intersection of the n − 1 hypersurfaces specified by these invariants. thus, the flow is perpendicular to all n − 1 gradients of these hamiltonians, whence parallel to  the generalized cross product specified by the respective nambu bracket.
nambu mechanics can be extended to fluid dynamics, where the resulting nambu brackets are non-canonical and the hamiltonians are identified with the casimir of the system, such as enstrophy or helicityquantizing nambu dynamics leads to intriguing structures which coincide with conventional quantization ones when superintegrable systems are involved—as they must.
