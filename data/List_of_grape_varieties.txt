this list of grape varieties includes cultivated grapes, whether used for wine, or eating as a table grape, fresh or dried (raisin, currant, sultana). for a complete list of all grape species including those unimportant to agriculture, see vitis.
the term grape variety refers to cultivars rather than actual botanical varieties according to the international code of nomenclature for cultivated plants, because they are propagated by cuttings and may have unstable reproductive properties. however, the term variety has become so entrenched in viticulture that any change to using the term cultivar instead is unlikely.


== single species grapes ==
while some of the grapes in this list are hybrids, they are hybridized within a single species. for those grapes hybridized across species, known as interspecific hybrids, see the section on multispecies hybrid grapes below.

=== vinifera hybrids (wine) ===
hybrid grape varieties (see hybrid grapes) or "hybrids" is, in fact, the popular term for a subset of what are properly known as hybrids, specifically crossings between one species of the genus vitis and another. the scientific definition of a hybrid grape is any crossing (intra- or inter-specific) of two grape varieties. in keeping with the popular definition, however, the ones listed below are inter-specific hybrids where one parent is a european grape. most of these are complex mixtures of three or more species and all parents are not always clearly known.
