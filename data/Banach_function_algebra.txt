in functional analysis, a banach function algebra on a compact hausdorff space x is unital subalgebra, a, of the commutative c*-algebra  c(x) of all continuous, complex-valued functions from x, together with a norm on a that makes it a banach algebra.
a function algebra is said to vanish at a point p if f(p) = 0 for all 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\in a}
  . a function algebra separates points if for each distinct pair of points 
  
    
      
        p
        ,
        q
        ∈
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle p,q\in x}
  , there is a function 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\in a}
   such that 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        p
        )
        ≠
        f
        (
        q
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(p)\neq f(q)}
  .
for every 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in x}
   define 
  
    
      
        
          ε
          
            x
          
        
        (
        f
        )
        =
        f
        (
        x
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{x}(f)=f(x),}
   for 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\in a}
  . then 
  
    
      
        
          ε
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{x}}
  
is a  homomorphism (character) on 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  , non-zero if 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   does not vanish at 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .
theorem: a banach function algebra is semisimple (that is its jacobson radical is equal to zero) and  each commutative unital, semisimple banach algebra is isomorphic (via the gelfand transform) to a banach function algebra on its character space (the space of algebra homomorphisms from a into the complex numbers given the relative weak* topology).
if the norm on 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is the uniform norm (or sup-norm) on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , then 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is called
a uniform algebra. uniform algebras are an important special case of banach function algebras.
