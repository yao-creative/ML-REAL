discrete mathematics is a biweekly peer-reviewed scientific journal in the broad area of discrete mathematics, combinatorics, graph theory, and their applications. it was established in 1971 and is published by north-holland publishing company. it publishes both short notes, full length contributions, as well as survey articles. in addition, the journal publishes a number of special issues each year dedicated to a particular topic. although originally it published articles in french and german, it now allows only english language articles. the editor-in-chief is douglas west (university of illinois, urbana).
