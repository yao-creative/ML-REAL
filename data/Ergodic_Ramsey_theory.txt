ergodic ramsey theory is a branch of mathematics where problems motivated by additive combinatorics are proven using ergodic theory.


== history ==
ergodic ramsey theory arose shortly after endre szemerédi's proof that a set of positive upper density contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, when hillel furstenberg gave a new proof of this theorem using ergodic theory. it has since produced combinatorial results, some of which have yet to be obtained by other means, and has also given a deeper understanding of the structure of measure-preserving dynamical systems.


== szemerédi's theorem ==

szemerédi's theorem is a result in arithmetic combinatorics, concerning arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers. in 1936, erdős and turán conjectured that every set of integers a with positive natural density contains a k term arithmetic progression for every k. this conjecture, which became szemerédi's theorem, generalizes the statement of van der waerden's theorem. hillel furstenberg proved the theorem using ergodic principles in 1977.
