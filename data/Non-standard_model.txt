in model theory, a discipline within mathematical logic, a non-standard model is a model of a theory that is not isomorphic to the intended model (or standard model).


== existence ==
if the intended model is infinite and the language is first-order, then the löwenheim–skolem theorems guarantee the existence of non-standard models. the non-standard models can be chosen as elementary extensions or elementary substructures of the intended model.


== importance ==
non-standard models are studied in set theory, non-standard analysis and non-standard models of arithmetic.
