in probability theory, the probability generating function of a discrete random variable is a power series representation (the generating function) of the probability mass function of the random variable.  probability generating functions are often employed for their succinct description of the sequence of probabilities pr(x = i) in the probability mass function for a random variable x, and to make available the well-developed theory of power series with non-negative coefficients.

=== univariate case ===
if x is a discrete random variable taking values in the non-negative integers {0,1, ...}, then the probability generating function of x is defined as

  
    
      
        g
        (
        z
        )
        =
        e
        ⁡
        (
        
          z
          
            x
          
        
        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            x
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        p
        (
        x
        )
        
          z
          
            x
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(z)=\operatorname {e} (z^{x})=\sum _{x=0}^{\infty }p(x)z^{x},}
  where p is the probability mass function of x.  note that the subscripted notations gx and px are often used to emphasize that these pertain to a particular random variable x, and to its distribution. the power series converges absolutely at least for all complex numbers z with |z| ≤ 1; in many examples the radius of convergence is larger.

== properties ==


=== power series ===
probability generating functions obey all the rules of power series with non-negative coefficients.  in particular, g(1−) = 1, where g(1−) = limz→1g(z) from below, since the probabilities must sum to one. so the radius of convergence of any probability generating function must be at least 1, by abel's theorem for power series with non-negative coefficients.


=== probabilities and expectations ===
the following properties allow the derivation of various basic quantities related to x:

the probability mass function of x is recovered by taking derivatives of g,

  
    
      
        p
        (
        k
        )
        =
        pr
        ⁡
        (
        x
        =
        k
        )
        =
        
          
            
              
                g
                
                  (
                  k
                  )
                
              
              (
              0
              )
            
            
              k
              !
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(k)=\operatorname {pr} (x=k)={\frac {g^{(k)}(0)}{k!}}.}
  
it follows from property 1 that if random variables x and y have probability-generating functions that are equal, 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            x
          
        
        =
        
          g
          
            y
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{x}=g_{y}}
  , then 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            x
          
        
        =
        
          p
          
            y
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{x}=p_{y}}
  .  that is, if x and y have identical probability-generating functions, then they have identical distributions.
the normalization of the probability density function can be expressed in terms of the generating function by

        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {e} (x(x-1)\cdots (x-k+1))}
   of x is given by

  
    
      
        e
        ⁡

so the variance of x is given by

=== functions of independent random variables ===
probability generating functions are particularly useful for dealing with functions of independent random variables. for example:

if x1, x2, ..., xn is a sequence of independent (and not necessarily identically distributed) random variables, and
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          a
          
            i

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{n}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}x_{i},}
  where the ai are constants, then the probability generating function is given by

the probability generating function is an example of a generating function of a sequence: see also formal power series. it is equivalent to, and sometimes called, the z-transform of the probability mass function.
other generating functions of random variables include the moment-generating function, the characteristic function and the cumulant generating function. the probability generating function is also equivalent to the factorial moment generating function, which as
