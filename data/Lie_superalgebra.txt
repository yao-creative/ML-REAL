in mathematics, a lie superalgebra is a generalisation of a lie algebra to include a z2-grading. lie superalgebras are important in theoretical physics where they are used to describe the mathematics of supersymmetry. in most of these theories, the even elements of the superalgebra correspond to bosons and odd elements to fermions (but this is not always true; for example, the brst supersymmetry is the other way around).


== definition ==
formally, a lie superalgebra is a nonassociative z2-graded algebra, or superalgebra, over a commutative ring (typically r or c) whose product [·, ·], called the lie superbracket or supercommutator, satisfies the two conditions (analogs of the usual lie algebra axioms, with grading):
super skew-symmetry:

  where x, y, and z are pure in the z2-grading. here, |x| denotes the degree of x (either 0 or 1). the degree of [x,y] is the sum of degree of x and y modulo 2.
one also sometimes adds the axioms 
  
    
      
        [
        x
        ,
        x
        ]
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle [x,x]=0}
   for |x| = 0 (if 2 is invertible this follows automatically) and 
  
    
      
        [
        [
        x
        ,
        x
        ]
        ,
        x
        ]
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle [[x,x],x]=0}
   for |x| = 1 (if 3 is invertible this follows automatically). when the ground ring is the integers or the lie superalgebra is a free module, these conditions are equivalent to the condition that the poincaré–birkhoff–witt theorem holds (and, in general, they are necessary conditions for the theorem to hold).
just as for lie algebras, the universal enveloping algebra of the lie superalgebra can be given a hopf algebra structure.
a graded lie algebra (say, graded by z or n) that is anticommutative and jacobi in the graded sense also has a 
  
    
      
        
          z
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{2}}
   grading (which is called "rolling up" the algebra into odd and even parts), but is not referred to as "super". see note at graded lie algebra for discussion.

== involution ==
a ∗ lie superalgebra is a complex lie superalgebra equipped with an involutive antilinear map from itself to itself which respects the z2 grading and satisfies
[x,y]* = [y*,x*] for all x and y in the lie superalgebra. (some authors prefer the convention [x,y]* = (−1)|x||y|[y*,x*]; changing * to −* switches between the two conventions.) its universal enveloping algebra would be an ordinary *-algebra.

== classification ==
the simple complex finite-dimensional lie superalgebras were classified by victor kac.
the basic classical compact lie superalgebras (that are not lie algebras) are: [1]
su(m/n) these are the superunitary lie algebras which have invariants:

  
    
      
        z
        .
        
          
            z
            ¯
          
        
        +
        i
        w
        .
        
          
            w
            ¯
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z.{\overline {z}}+iw.{\overline {w}}}
  this gives two orthosymplectic (see below) invariants if we take the m z variables and n w variables to be non-commutative and we take the real and imaginary parts. therefore, we have

  
    
      
        s
        u
        (
        m
        
          /
        
        n
        )
        =
        o
        s
        p
        (
        2
        m
        
          /
        
        2
        n
        )
        ∩
        o
        s
        p
        (
        2
        n
        
          /
        
        2
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle su(m/n)=osp(2m/2n)\cap osp(2n/2m)}
  su(n/n)/u(1) a special case of the superunitary lie algebras where we remove one u(1) generator to make the algebra simple.
osp(m/2n) these are the orthosymplectic groups. they have invariants given by:

  
    
      
        x
        .
        x
        +
        y
        .
        z
        −
        z
        .
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.x+y.z-z.y}
  for m commutative variables (x) and n pairs of anti-commutative variables (y,z). they are important symmetries in supergravity theories.
d(2/1;
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  ) this is a set of superalgebras parameterised by the variable 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  . it has dimension 17 and is a sub-algebra of osp(9|8). the even part of the group is o(3)×o(3)×o(3). so the invariants are:

== classification of infinite-dimensional simple linearly compact lie superalgebras ==
the classification consists of the 10 series w(m, n), s(m, n) ((m, n) ≠ (1, 1)), h(2m, n), k(2m + 1, n), ho(m, m) (m ≥ 2), sho(m, m) (m ≥ 3), ko(m, m + 1), sko(m, m + 1; β) (m ≥ 2), sho ∼ (2m, 2m), sko ∼ (2m + 1, 2m + 3) and the five exceptional algebras:

e(1, 6), e(5, 10), e(4, 4), e(3, 6), e(3, 8)the last two are particularly interesting (according to kac) because they have the standard model gauge group su(3)×su(2)×u(1) as their zero level algebra. infinite-dimensional (affine) lie superalgebras are important symmetries in superstring theory. specifically, the virasoro algebras with 
  
    
      
        
          
            n

   supersymmetries are

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k(1,{\mathcal {n}})}
   which only have central extensions up to
