== common elements ==


=== plot and themes ===
the first game explains that "splinter cell" refers to an elite recon-type unit of single covert operatives (such as sam fisher) who are supported in the field by a high-tech remote team.
in the first three games (splinter cell, pandora tomorrow, chaos theory), terrorists are planning attacks, usually by use of information warfare, which sam fisher, an operative for third echelon, a secret branch of the nsa, must prevent. the missions range from gathering intelligence to capturing and/or eliminating terrorists.
in the fourth game, double agent, fisher assumes the identity of a wanted criminal in order to infiltrate a terrorist ring.
the fifth game, conviction, starts after events in the conclusion of double agent: sam has abandoned third echelon. when he discovers that the death of his daughter sarah had not been an accident (as had been purported at the beginning of double agent), he strikes out on his own in search of those responsible until sam's investigation uncovers a conspiracy within his old agency.
in the sixth and most recent game, blacklist, third echelon has been disbanded by the president of the united states. a new outfit, fourth echelon, is formed by the president and placed under the command of sam fisher with the mission of stopping the blacklist attacks and the engineers - the organization behind them. blacklist deals with the morality of war and how far sam and his team go in order to prevent these plots against america.


==== trifocal goggles ====

a device used for seeing in the dark features strongly in the series. originally, tom clancy had rejected the idea of sam fisher having these "trifocal goggles", having stated that such goggles (with both thermal vision and night vision) were impossible to make. the creators argued that having two separate sets of goggles would have made for awkward gameplay and convinced clancy to allow it. this also gave the splinter cell series a recognizable signature, a desirable feature. chaos theory added a third one, electromagnetic view, which shows the path of electricity in the area, mainly electrical cables and any device that has electrical power, like tvs, computers, etc. conviction allows a fourth module to be accessed, a sonar module that can scan through walls for interactable objects, such as weapons, people, and consoles.
the trifocal goggles however, didn't remain completely fictional. in 2004, northrop grumman produced and delivered one such device. the device, called fused multispectral weapon sight (fmws) was capable of combining thermal and intensified imaging. later in 2007, itt industries developed another such device, designated an/psq-20.


=== characters ===
the characters of the games, as well as the organization "third echelon", were created by j. t. petty. the main recurring ones are:

sam fisher is the main protagonist of the series. the character ranks 24th on the "guinness top 50 video game characters of all time" list.
irving lambert, leader of "third echelon", serves as the player's guide by leading fisher through the games' missions, until he is killed by sam in double agent.
anna "grim" grimsdÃ³ttÃ­r is portrayed as an official third echelon hacker and analyst, who helps fisher when technical obstacles need to be overcome. in conviction she takes over the role of guide from the deceased lambert; her character also becomes the source of dramatic tension in the story.  in blacklist, she is the technical operations officer and butts heads with sam over morality, ethics, and fourth echelon's operating parameters.
sarah fisher, sam's daughter and sole family member. she was presumed to be killed in double agent, but conviction revealed her murder to be a deception.


=== gameplay ===
the encouraged way to progress through the games is to remain hidden, select non-obvious routes, and utilize diversions to pass guards. the first game in the series only features a single-player mode, pandora tomorrow introduces a two-on-two multiplayer mode. chaos theory further develops that mode and introduces a cooperative mode. cooperative mode plays similarly to the single player mode, but adds situations that can only be overcome as a team. the cooperative storylines in chaos theory and the sixth generation version of double agent parallel those of sam's actions in the single-player modes, letting players act on information he obtained or provide support in the field.
double agent introduces a morality factor: fisher may now encounter conflicting objectives between his superiors and the terrorists. for example, the terrorists may assign a mission to assassinate someone, while the nsa simultaneously instructs the player to prevent the assassination. this creates a delicate balancing act between gaining the trust of the terrorists and fulfilling the mission assignments. in addition, fisher must not do anything to reveal to the terrorists that he is a double agent (such as let himself be seen with an nsa gadget), otherwise he will lose instantly.
conviction utilises a much faster and more violent form of stealth action gameplay than previous games in the series. it retains the cooperative multiplayer mode of the two preceding games.
the weapons that sam fisher uses are based more accurately on current real-world weapons which behave accordingly and all weapons can be upgraded by a points system. this points system is secondary to the main storyline and is achievement based. these points may be used to add silencers, sights, upgraded ammo, laser targeting and other upgrades, with up to three upgrades per weapon.
this game provides an interactive mission update sequence that is built into the levels themselves. instead of getting an objective-bar popup, the objective may appear in bold white text on the side of a building or in front of a barricade. this adds to the immersion and keeps the hud uncluttered. the stealth element of the game allows fisher to hide in the shadows and become almost invisible. guards may be assassinated by unsuppressed or silenced weapons, gadgets, or hand-to-hand combat. after successfully completing a hand-to-hand kill, the player is provided with an 'execution' bonus, which allows the player to mark two to four targets (depending on the weapon selected) such as enemies or objects, and trigger the execution animation. fisher will then dispatch all targets within a few seconds in an extraordinary fashion.
interactive interrogation cutscenes where fisher beats up a target for information do not require the player to do anything other than press [interrogate]. though if the player happens to be near an interactive object like a television or table, fisher may use that to alter the standard animation.


== development and history ==


=== origin ===
although the game features his name, tom clancy had little to no involvement in the development of any of the splinter cell games.
according to splinter cell series producer mathieu ferland, the original game was developed so that ubisoft's montreal studio could demonstrate its full potential. after tom clancy's rainbow six and tom clancy's ghost recon, "special ops was the natural next step" for tom clancy-endorsed games.


=== graphics and technology ===
the first game in the series modified the unreal engine to allow the light-and-dark-based gameplay style. the other games continued this, using updated versions of the engine.
by the release of the latest game â€“ blacklist â€“ the engine had been upgraded to the lead engine, a heavily modified version of the unreal engine 2.5. the game had active shadows on all consoles not simply as a graphical function â€“ as in most games â€“ but as a gameplay enhancer for the sake of the game's stealth features. this meant that more coding for the game was required and overall, required a powerful desktop computer in order to get the best clarity and performance.


== reception ==
by the end of 2004, sales of the splinter cell series totaled 9.6 million units. by october 2005, the series' global sales had surpassed 12.5 million units.


== other media ==


=== film adaptation ===
originally announced as a special feature on splinter cell: chaos theory, a film adaptation for the series was confirmed to be in development, as early as 2005.
