a two-dimensional conformal field theory is a quantum field theory on a euclidean two-dimensional space, that is invariant under local conformal transformations.
in contrast to other types of conformal field theories, two-dimensional conformal field theories have infinite-dimensional symmetry algebras. in some cases, this allows them to be solved exactly, using the conformal bootstrap  method.
notable two-dimensional conformal field theories include minimal models, liouville theory, massless free bosonic theories, wess–zumino–witten models, and certain sigma models.

=== geometry ===
two-dimensional conformal field theories (cfts) are defined on riemann surfaces, where local conformal maps are holomorphic functions. 
while a cft might conceivably exist only on a given riemann surface, its existence on any surface other than the sphere implies its existence on all surfaces.
given a cft, it is indeed possible to glue two riemann surfaces where it exists, and obtain the cft on the glued surface.
on the other hand, some cfts exist only on the sphere. 
unless stated otherwise, we consider cft on the sphere in this article.

   generate a witt algebra.
by standard quantum-mechanical arguments, the symmetry algebra of conformal field theory must be the central extension of the witt algebra, i.e. the virasoro algebra, whose generators are 
  
    
      
        (
        
          l
          
            n

    {\displaystyle (l_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {z} }}
  , plus a central generator. in a given cft, the central generator takes a constant value 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  , called the central charge.
the symmetry algebra is therefore the product of two copies of the virasoro algebra: the left-moving or holomorphic algebra, with generators 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{n}}
  , and the right-moving or antiholomorphic algebra, with generators 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                l
                ¯
              
            
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {l}}_{n}}
  .in the universal enveloping algebra of the virasoro, algebra, it is possible to construct an infinite set of mutually commuting charges. the first charge is 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            0
          
        
        −
        
          
            c
            24
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{0}-{\frac {c}{24}}}
  , the second charge is quadratic in virasoro generators, the third charge is cubic, etc. this shows that any two-dimensional conformal field theory is also a quantum integrable system.


=== space of states ===
the space of states, also called the spectrum, of a cft, is a representation of the product of the two virasoro algebras.

a cft is called diagonal if its space of states is a direct sum of representations of the type

        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
   is an indecomposable representation of the left virasoro algebra, and

    {\displaystyle l_{n}^{\dagger }=l_{-n}}
  , and that the central charge is real. the space of states is then a hilbert space. while unitarity is necessary for a cft to be a proper quantum system with a probabilistic interpretation, many interesting cfts are nevertheless non-unitary, including minimal models and liouville theory for most allowed values of the central charge.

in particular, the image of a primary state of a lowest weight representation of the virasoro algebra is a primary field

== chiral conformal field theory ==
in a two-dimensional conformal field theory, properties are called chiral if they follow from the action of one of the two virasoro algebras. if the space of states can be decomposed into factorized representations of the product of the two virasoro algebras, then all consequences of conformal symmetry are chiral. in other words, the actions of the two virasoro algebras can be studied separately.

=== conformal ward identities ===
conformal ward identities are linear equations that correlation functions obey as a consequence of conformal symmetry. they can be derived by studying correlation functions that involve insertions of the energy–momentum tensor. their solutions are conformal blocks.
for example, consider conformal ward identities on the sphere. let 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   be a global complex coordinate on the sphere, viewed as 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        ∪

        }

=== bpz equations ===
a correlation function that involves a degenerate field satisfies a linear partial differential equation called a belavin–polyakov–zamolodchikov equation after alexander belavin, alexander polyakov and alexander zamolodchikov. the order of this equation is the level of the null vector in the corresponding degenerate representation.
a trivial example is the order one bpz equation

=== fusion rules ===
in an ope that involves a degenerate field, the vanishing of the null vector (plus conformal symmetry) constrains which primary fields can appear. the resulting constraints are called fusion rules. using the momentum

  alternatively, fusion rules have an algebraic definition in terms of an associative fusion product of representations of the virasoro algebra at a given central charge. the fusion product differs from the tensor product of representations. (in a tensor product, the central charges add.) in certain finite cases, this leads to the structure of a fusion category.
a conformal field theory is quasi-rational is the fusion product of two indecomposable representations is a sum of finitely many indecomposable representations. for example, generalized minimal models are quasi-rational without being rational.


== conformal bootstrap ==
the conformal bootstrap method consists in defining and solving cfts using only symmetry and consistency assumptions, by reducing all correlation functions to combinations of structure constants and conformal blocks.
in two dimensions, this method leads to exact solutions of certain cfts, and to classifications of rational theories.

=== conformal blocks ===

any correlation function can be written as a linear combination of conformal blocks: functions that are determined by conformal symmetry, and labelled by representations of the symmetry algebra. the coefficients of the linear combination are products of structure constants.in two-dimensional cft, the symmetry algebra is factorized into two copies of the virasoro algebra, and a conformal block that involves primary fields has a holomorphic factorization: it is a product of a locally holomorphic factor that is determined by the left-moving virasoro algebra, and a locally antiholomorphic factor that is determined by the right-moving virasoro algebra. these factors are themselves called conformal blocks.
for example, using the ope of the first two fields in a four-point function of primary fields yields

   is an s-channel four-point conformal block. four-point conformal blocks are complicated functions that can be efficiently computed using alexei zamolodchikov's recursion relations. if one of the four fields is degenerate, then the corresponding conformal blocks obey bpz equations. if in particular one the four fields is 
  
    
      
        
          v

            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{2,1}}
  , then the corresponding conformal blocks can be written in terms of the hypergeometric function.
as first explained by witten, the space of conformal blocks of a two-dimensional cft can be identified with the quantum hilbert space of a 2+1 dimensional chern-simons theory, which is an example of a topological field theory. this connection has been very fruitful  in the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect.


=== conformal bootstrap equations ===
when a correlation function can be written in terms of conformal blocks in several different ways, the equality of the resulting expressions provides constraints on the space of states and on three-point structure constants. these constraints are called the conformal bootstrap equations. while the ward identities are linear equations for correlation functions, the conformal bootstrap equations depend non-linearly on the three-point structure constants.
for example, a four-point function 
  
    
      
        
          ⟨
          
            
              v
              
                1
              
            
            
              v
              
                2
              
            
            
              v
              
                3

                4
              
            
          
          ⟩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\langle v_{1}v_{2}v_{3}v_{4}\right\rangle }
   can be written in terms of conformal blocks in three inequivalent ways, corresponding to using the opes 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            1
          
        
        
          v
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{1}v_{2}}
   (s-channel), 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            1
          
        
        
          v
          
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{1}v_{4}}
   (t-channel) or 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            1
          
        
        
          v
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{1}v_{3}}
   (u-channel). the equality of the three resulting expressions is called crossing symmetry of the four-point function, and is equivalent to the associativity of the ope.for example, the torus partition function is invariant under the action of the modular group on the modulus of the torus, equivalently 
  
    
      
        z
        (
        τ
        )
        =
        z
        (
        τ
        +
        1
        )
        =
        z
        (
        −
        
          
            1
            τ
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle z(\tau )=z(\tau +1)=z(-{\frac {1}{\tau }})}
  . this invariance is a constraint on the space of states. the study of modular invariant torus partition functions is sometimes called the modular bootstrap.
the consistency of a cft on the sphere is equivalent to crossing symmetry of the four-point function. the consistency of a cft on all riemann surfaces also requires modular invariance of the torus one-point function. modular invariance of the torus partition function is therefore neither necessary, nor sufficient, for a cft to exist. it has however been widely studied in rational cfts, because characters of representations are simpler than other kinds of conformal blocks, such as sphere four-point conformal blocks.

  liouville theory has been solved, in the sense that its three-point structure constants are explicitly known. liouville theory has applications to string theory, and to two-dimensional quantum gravity.


=== extended symmetry algebras ===
in some cfts, the symmetry algebra is not just the virasoro algebra, but an associative algebra (i.e. not necessarily a lie algebra) that contains the virasoro algebra. the spectrum is then decomposed into representations of that algebra, and the notions of diagonal and rational cfts are defined with respect to that algebra.


==== massless free bosonic theories ====

in two dimensions, massless free bosonic theories are conformally invariant. their symmetry algebra is the affine lie algebra 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  u
                
                ^
              
            
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathfrak {u}}}_{1}}
   built from the abelian, rank one lie algebra. the fusion product of any two representations of this symmetry algebra yields only one representation, and this makes correlation functions very simple.
viewing minimal models and liouville theory as perturbed free bosonic theories leads to the coulomb gas method for computing their correlation functions. moreover, for 
  
    
      
        c
        =
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle c=1,}
   there is a one-parameter family of free bosonic theories with infinite discrete spectrums, which describe compactified free bosons, with the parameter being the compactification radius.


==== wess–zumino–witten models ====

given a lie group 
  
    
      
        g
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle g,}
   the corresponding wess–zumino–witten model is a cft whose symmetry algebra is the affine lie algebra built from the lie algebra of 
  
    
      
        g
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g.}
   if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is compact, then this cft is rational, its central charge takes discrete values, and its spectrum is known.


==== superconformal field theories ====
the symmetry algebra of a supersymmetric cft is a super virasoro algebra, or a larger algebra. supersymmetric cfts are in particular relevant to superstring theory.


==== theories based on w-algebras ====
w-algebras are natural extensions of the virasoro algebra. cfts based on w-algebras include generalizations of minimal models and liouville theory, respectively called w-minimal models and conformal toda theories. conformal toda theories are more complicated than liouville theory, and less well understood.


=== sigma models ===
in two dimensions, classical sigma models are conformally invariant, but only some target manifolds lead to quantum sigma models that are conformally invariant. examples of such target manifolds include toruses, and calabi–yau manifolds.


=== logarithmic conformal field theories ===

logarithmic conformal field theories are two-dimensional cfts such that the action of the virasoro algebra generator 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{0}}
   on the spectrum is not diagonalizable. in particular, the spectrum cannot be built solely from lowest weight representations. as a consequence, the dependence of correlation functions on the positions of the fields can be logarithmic. this contrasts with the power-like dependence of the two- and three-point functions that are associated to lowest weight representations.


=== critical q-state potts model ===
the critical 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
  -state potts model or critical random cluster model is a conformal field theory that generalizes and unifies the critical ising model, potts model, and percolation. the model has a parameter 
  
    
      
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle q}
  , which must be integer in the potts model, but which can take any complex value in the random cluster model. this parameter is related to the central charge by

        =
        4
