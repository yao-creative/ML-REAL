in mathematics, hodge–arakelov theory of elliptic curves is an analogue of classical and p-adic hodge theory for elliptic curves carried out in the framework of arakelov theory. it was introduced by mochizuki (1999). 
the main comparison in his theory remains unpublished as of 2019.
mochizuki's main comparison  theorem in hodge–arakelov theory states (roughly) that the space of polynomial functions of degree less than d on the universal extension of a smooth elliptic curve in characteristic 0 is naturally isomorphic (via restriction) to the d2-dimensional space of functions on the d-torsion points. it is called a comparison theorem as it is an analogue for arakelov theory of comparison theorems in cohomology relating de rham cohomology to singular cohomology of complex varieties or étale cohomology of p-adic varieties.
in mochizuki (1999) and mochizuki (2002a) he pointed out that arithmetic kodaira–spencer map and gauss–manin connection may give some important hints for vojta's conjecture, abc conjecture and so on.
