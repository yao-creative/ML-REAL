in mathematics, fredholm operators are certain operators that arise in the fredholm theory of integral equations. they are named in honour of erik ivar fredholm. by definition, a fredholm operator is a bounded linear operator t : x → y between two banach spaces with finite-dimensional kernel

== properties ==
intuitively, fredholm operators are those operators that are invertible "if finite-dimensional effects are ignored." the formally correct statement follows. a bounded operator t : x → y between banach spaces  x and y is fredholm if and only if it is invertible modulo compact operators, i.e., if there exists a bounded linear operator

  
    
      
        s
        :
        y
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle s:y\to x}
  such that

  
    
      
        
          
            i
            d

        s

          and
        
        
        
          
            i
            d
          
          
            y
          
        
        −
        t
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {id} _{x}-st\quad {\text{and}}\quad \mathrm {id} _{y}-ts}
  are compact operators on x and y respectively.
if a fredholm operator is modified slightly, it stays fredholm and its index remains the same. formally: the set of fredholm operators from x to y is open in the banach space l(x, y) of bounded linear operators, equipped with the operator norm, and the index is locally constant.  more precisely, if t0 is fredholm from x to y, there exists ε > 0 such that every t in l(x, y) with ||t − t0|| < ε is fredholm, with the same index as that of t0.
when t is fredholm from x to y and u fredholm from y to z, then the composition 
  
    
      
        u
        ∘
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\circ t}
   is fredholm from x to z and

  
    
      
        
          i
          n
          d
        
        (
        u
        ∘
        t
        )
        =
        
          i
          n
          d
        
        (
        u
        )
        +
        
          i
          n
          d
        
        (
        t
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {ind} (u\circ t)=\mathrm {ind} (u)+\mathrm {ind} (t).}
  when t is fredholm, the transpose (or adjoint) operator t ′ is fredholm from y ′ to x ′, and ind(t ′) = −ind(t).  when x and y are hilbert spaces, the same conclusion holds for the hermitian adjoint t∗.
when t is fredholm and k a compact operator, then t + k is fredholm.  the index of t remains unchanged under such a compact perturbations of t.  this follows from the fact that the index i(s) of t + s k is an integer defined for every s in [0, 1], and i(s) is locally constant, hence i(1) = i(0).
invariance by perturbation is true for larger classes than the class of compact operators.  for example, when u is fredholm and t a strictly singular operator, then t + u is fredholm with the same index.  the class of inessential operators, which properly contains the class of strictly singular operators, is the "perturbation class" for fredholm operators.  this means an operator

        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle t\in b(x,y)}
   is inessential if and only if t+u is fredholm for every fredholm operator 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        b
        (
        x

any elliptic operator can be extended to a fredholm operator. the use of fredholm operators in partial differential equations is an abstract form of the parametrix method.
the atiyah-singer index theorem gives a topological characterization of the index of certain operators on manifolds.
the atiyah-jänich theorem identifies the k-theory k(x) of a compact topological space x with the set of homotopy classes of continuous maps from x to the space of fredholm operators h→h, where h is the separable hilbert space and the set of these operators carries the operator norm.

        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is called a b-fredholm operator. the index of a b-fredholm operator 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is defined as the index of the fredholm operator 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{n}}
  .  it is  shown that the index is independent of the integer 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  .
b-fredholm operators were introduced by m. berkani in 1999 as a generalization of fredholm operators.


=== semi-fredholm operators ===
a bounded linear operator t is called semi-fredholm if its range is closed and at least one of

=== unbounded operators ===
one may also define unbounded fredholm operators. let x and y be two banach spaces.

the closed linear operator 
  
    
      
        t
        :
        
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle t:\,x\to y}
   is called fredholm if its domain 
  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {d}}(t)}
   is dense in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , its range is closed, and both kernel and cokernel of t are finite-dimensional.

  
    
      
        t
        :
        
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle t:\,x\to y}
   is called semi-fredholm if its domain 
  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {d}}(t)}
   is dense in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , its range is closed, and either kernel or cokernel of t (or both) is finite-dimensional.as it was noted above, the range of a closed operator is closed as long as the cokernel is finite-dimensional (edmunds and evans, theorem i.3.2).
