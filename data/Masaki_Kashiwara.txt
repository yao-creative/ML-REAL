masaki kashiwara (柏原 正樹, kashiwara masaki, born january 30, 1947 in yūki, ibaraki) is a japanese mathematician. he was a student of mikio sato at the university of tokyo. kashiwara made leading contributions towards algebraic analysis, microlocal analysis, d-module theory, hodge theory, sheaf theory and representation theory.kashiwara and sato established the foundations of the theory of systems of linear partial differential equations with analytic coefficients, introducing a cohomological approach that follows the spirit of grothendieck's theory of schemes. bernstein introduced a similar approach in the polynomial coefficients case. kashiwara's master thesis states the foundations of d-module theory. his phd thesis proves the rationality of the roots of b-functions (bernstein–sato polynomials), using d-module theory and resolution of singularities. he was a plenary speaker at international congress of mathematicians, 1978, helsinki and an invited speaker, 1990, kyoto.
he is a member of the french academy of sciences and of the japan academy.
