in mathematics, a generating function is a way of encoding an infinite sequence of numbers (an) by treating them as the coefficients of a formal power series. this series is called the generating function of the sequence. unlike an ordinary series, the formal power series is not required to converge: in fact, the generating function is not actually regarded as a function, and the "variable" remains an indeterminate. generating functions were first introduced by abraham de moivre in 1730, in order to solve the general linear recurrence problem. one can generalize to formal power series in more than one indeterminate, to encode information about infinite multi-dimensional arrays of numbers.
there are various types of generating functions, including ordinary generating functions, exponential generating functions, lambert series, bell series, and dirichlet series; definitions and examples are given below. every sequence in principle has a generating function of each type (except that lambert and dirichlet series require indices to start at 1 rather than 0), but the ease with which they can be handled may differ considerably. the particular generating function, if any, that is most useful in a given context will depend upon the nature of the sequence and the details of the problem being addressed.
generating functions are often expressed in closed form (rather than as a series), by some expression involving operations defined for formal series. these expressions in terms of the indeterminate x may involve arithmetic operations, differentiation with respect to x and composition with (i.e., substitution into) other generating functions; since these operations are also defined for functions, the result looks like a function of x. indeed, the closed form expression can often be interpreted as a function that can be evaluated at (sufficiently small) concrete values of x, and which has the formal series as its series expansion; this explains the designation "generating functions". however such interpretation is not required to be possible, because formal series are not required to give a convergent series when a nonzero numeric value is substituted for x. also, not all expressions that are meaningful as functions of x are meaningful as expressions designating formal series; for example, negative and fractional powers of x are examples of functions that do not have a corresponding formal power series.
generating functions are not functions in the formal sense of a mapping from a domain to a codomain. generating functions are sometimes called generating series, in that a series of terms can be said to be the generator of its sequence of term coefficients.


== definitions ==
a generating function is a device somewhat similar to a bag. instead of carrying many little objects detachedly, which could be embarrassing, we put them all in a bag, and then we have only one object to carry, the bag.
a generating function is a clothesline on which we hang up a sequence of numbers for display.


=== ordinary generating function (ogf) ===
the ordinary generating function of a sequence an is

when the term generating function is used without qualification, it is usually taken to mean an ordinary generating function.
if an is the probability mass function of a discrete random variable, then its ordinary generating function is called a probability-generating function.
the ordinary generating function can be generalized to arrays with multiple indices. for example, the ordinary generating function of a two-dimensional array am, n (where n and m are natural numbers) is


=== exponential generating function (egf) ===
the exponential generating function of a sequence an is

exponential generating functions are generally more convenient than ordinary generating functions for combinatorial enumeration problems that involve labelled objects.

formal dirichlet series are often classified as generating functions, although they are not strictly formal power series. the dirichlet series generating function of a sequence an is
the dirichlet series generating function is especially useful when an is a multiplicative function, in which case it has an euler product expression in terms of the function's bell series

if an is a dirichlet character then its dirichlet series generating function is called a dirichlet l-series.

=== polynomial sequence generating functions ===
the idea of generating functions can be extended to sequences of other objects. thus, for example, polynomial sequences of binomial type are generated by

where pn(x) is a sequence of polynomials and f(t) is a function of a certain form. sheffer sequences are generated in a similar way. see the main article generalized appell polynomials for more information.


== ordinary generating functions ==


=== examples of generating functions for simple sequences ===
polynomials are a special case of ordinary generating functions, corresponding to finite sequences, or equivalently sequences that vanish after a certain point. these are important in that many finite sequences can usefully be interpreted as generating functions, such as the poincaré polynomial and others.
a fundamental generating function is that of the constant sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ..., whose ordinary generating function is the geometric series

the left-hand side is the maclaurin series expansion of the right-hand side. alternatively, the equality can be justified by multiplying the power series on the left by 1 − x, and checking that the result is the constant power series 1 (in other words, that all coefficients except the one of x0 are equal to 0). moreover, there can be no other power series with this property. the left-hand side therefore designates the multiplicative inverse of 1 − x in the ring of power series.
expressions for the ordinary generating function of other sequences are easily derived from this one. for instance, the substitution x → ax gives the generating function for the geometric sequence 1, a, a2, a3, ... for any constant a:

(the equality also follows directly from the fact that the left-hand side is the maclaurin series expansion of the right-hand side.) in particular,

one can also introduce regular "gaps" in the sequence by replacing x by some power of x, so for instance for the sequence 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... (which skips over x, x3, x5, ...) one gets the generating function

by squaring the initial generating function, or by finding the derivative of both sides with respect to x and making a change of running variable n → n + 1, one sees that the coefficients form the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., so one has

and the third power has as coefficients the triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ... whose term n is the binomial coefficient 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              (
            
            
              
                n
                +
                2
              
              2
            
            
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle {\binom {n+2}{2}}}
  , so that

more generally, for any non-negative integer k and non-zero real value a, it is true that

since

one can find the ordinary generating function for the sequence 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ... of square numbers by linear combination of binomial-coefficient generating sequences:

we may also expand alternately to generate this same sequence of squares as a sum of derivatives of the geometric series in the following form:

by induction, we can similarly show for positive integers

=== rational functions ===

the ordinary generating function of a sequence can be expressed as a rational function (the ratio of two finite-degree polynomials) if and only if the sequence is a linear recursive sequence with constant coefficients; this generalizes the examples above. conversely, every sequence generated by a fraction of polynomials satisfies a linear recurrence with constant coefficients; these coefficients are identical to the coefficients of the fraction denominator polynomial (so they can be directly read off). this observation shows it is easy to solve for generating functions of sequences defined by a linear finite difference equation with constant coefficients, and then hence, for explicit closed-form formulas for the coefficients of these generating functions. the prototypical example here is to derive binet's formula for the fibonacci numbers via generating function techniques.
we also notice that the class of rational generating functions precisely corresponds to the generating functions that enumerate quasi-polynomial sequences of the form 
where the reciprocal roots, 
  
    
      
        
          ρ

then this generating function's diagonal coefficient generating function is given by the well-known ogf formula

this result is computed in many ways, including cauchy's integral formula or contour integration, taking complex residues, or by direct manipulations of formal power series in two variables.


=== operations on generating functions ===


==== multiplication yields convolution ====

multiplication of ordinary generating functions yields a discrete convolution (the cauchy product) of the sequences. for example, the sequence of cumulative sums (compare to the slightly more general euler–maclaurin formula)

of a sequence with ordinary generating function g(an; x) has the generating function

because 1/(1 − x) is the ordinary generating function for the sequence (1, 1, ...). see also the section on convolutions in the applications section of this article below for further examples of problem solving with convolutions of generating functions and interpretations.

  , we have the following two analogous identities for the modified generating functions enumerating the shifted sequence variants of 
  
    
      
        ⟨

  , respectively:


==== differentiation and integration of generating functions ====
we have the following respective power series expansions for the first derivative of a generating function and its integral:

the differentiation–multiplication operation of the second identity can be repeated 
  
    
      
        k

   as follows (see the main article on generating function transformations):

a negative-order reversal of this sequence powers formula corresponding to the operation of repeated integration is defined by the zeta series transformation and its generalizations defined as a derivative-based transformation of generating functions, or alternately termwise by an performing an integral transformation on the sequence generating function. related operations of performing fractional integration on a sequence generating function are discussed here.

        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)}
   is said to be holonomic if it satisfies a linear differential equation of the form 
where the coefficients 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            i
          
        
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{i}(z)}
   are in the field of rational functions, 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} (z)}
  . equivalently, 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)}
   is holonomic if the vector space over 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} (z)}
   spanned by the set of all of its derivatives is finite dimensional.
since we can clear denominators if need be in the previous equation, we may assume that the functions, 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            i
          
        
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{i}(z)}
   are polynomials in 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  . thus we can see an equivalent condition that a generating function is holonomic if its coefficients satisfy a p-recurrence of the form

   and where the 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                c
                ^
              
            
          
          
            i
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widehat {c}}_{i}(n)}
   are fixed finite-degree polynomials in 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  . in other words, the properties that a sequence be p-recursive and have a holonomic generating function are equivalent. holonomic functions are closed under the hadamard product operation

==== software for working with p-recursive sequences and holonomic generating functions ====
tools for processing and working with p-recursive sequences in mathematica include the software packages provided for non-commercial use on the risc combinatorics group algorithmic combinatorics software site. despite being mostly closed-source, particularly powerful tools in this software suite are provided by the guess package for guessing p-recurrences for arbitrary input sequences (useful for experimental mathematics and exploration) and the sigma package which is able to find p-recurrences for many sums and solve for closed-form solutions to p-recurrences involving generalized harmonic numbers. other packages listed on this particular risc site are targeted at working with holonomic generating functions specifically.
(depending on how in depth this article gets on the topic, there are many, many other examples of useful software tools that can be listed here or on this page in another section.)


=== relation to discrete-time fourier transform ===

when the series converges absolutely,

is the discrete-time fourier transform of the sequence a0, a1, ….


=== asymptotic growth of a sequence ===
in calculus, often the growth rate of the coefficients of a power series can be used to deduce a radius of convergence for the power series. the reverse can also hold; often the radius of convergence for a generating function can be used to deduce the asymptotic growth of the underlying sequence.
for instance, if an ordinary generating function g(an; x) that has a finite radius of convergence of r can be written as

where each of a(x) and b(x) is a function that is analytic to a radius of convergence greater than r (or is entire), and where b(r) ≠ 0 then

using the gamma function, a binomial coefficient, or a multiset coefficient.
often this approach can be iterated to generate several terms in an asymptotic series for an. in particular,

the asymptotic growth of the coefficients of this generating function can then be sought via the finding of a, b, α, β, and r to describe the generating function, as above.
similar asymptotic analysis is possible for exponential generating functions. with an exponential generating function, it is an/n! that grows according to these asymptotic formulae.


==== asymptotic growth of the sequence of squares ====
as derived above, the ordinary generating function for the sequence of squares is

with r = 1, α = −1, β = 3, a(x) = 0, and b(x) = x + 1, we can verify that the squares grow as expected, like the squares:


==== asymptotic growth of the catalan numbers ====

the ordinary generating function for the catalan numbers is

with r = 1/4, α = 1, β = −1/2, a(x) = 1/2, and b(x) = −1/2, we can conclude that, for the catalan numbers,


=== bivariate and multivariate generating functions ===
one can define generating functions in several variables for arrays with several indices. these are called multivariate generating functions or, sometimes, super generating functions. for two variables, these are often called bivariate generating functions.
for instance, since 
  
    
      
        (
        1
        +
        x

    {\displaystyle (1+x)^{n}}
   is the ordinary generating function for binomial coefficients for a fixed n, one may ask for a bivariate generating function that generates the binomial coefficients

generating functions give us several methods to manipulate sums and to establish identities between sums.
the simplest case occurs when 
  
    
      
        
          s

  . we then know that 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        z
        )
        =

    {\textstyle h_{k}=1+{\frac {1}{2}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{k}}}
   are the harmonic numbers. let

finally, it follows that we may express the second sums through the first sums in the following form:


==== example 3: generating functions for mutually recursive sequences ====
in this example, we re-formulate a generating function example given in section 7.3 of concrete mathematics (see also section 7.1 of the same reference for pretty pictures of generating function series). in particular, suppose that we seek the total number of ways (denoted

since we have that for all integers

    {\textstyle \sum _{n\geq 0}g_{n+m}z^{n}={\frac {g(z)-g_{0}-g_{1}z-\cdots -g_{m-1}z^{m-1}}{z^{m}}}}
  ), we can use the initial conditions specified above and the previous two recurrence relations to see that we have the next two equations relating the generating functions for these sequences given by

which then implies by solving the system of equations (and this is the particular trick to our method here) that

thus by performing algebraic simplifications to the sequence resulting from the second partial fractions expansions of the generating function in the previous equation, we find that 
  
    
      
        
          u

            1
          
        
        ≡
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{2n+1}\equiv 0}
   and that

for all integers 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq 0}
  . we also note that the same shifted generating function technique applied to the second-order recurrence for the fibonacci numbers is the prototypical example of using generating functions to solve recurrence relations in one variable already covered, or at least hinted at, in the subsection on rational functions given above.


=== convolution (cauchy products) ===
a discrete convolution of the terms in two formal power series turns a product of generating functions into a generating function enumerating a convolved sum of the original sequence terms (see cauchy product).

consider a(z) and b(z) are ordinary generating functions. 
consider a(z) and b(z) are exponential generating functions. 
consider the triply convolved sequence resulting from the product of three ordinary generating functions 
consider the 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  -fold convolution of a sequence with itself for some positive integer 
  
    
      
        m
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\geq 1}
   (see the example below for an application) multiplication of generating functions, or convolution of their underlying sequences, can correspond to a notion of independent events in certain counting and probability scenarios. for example, if we adopt the notational convention that the probability generating function, or pgf, of a random variable 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   is denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            z
          
        
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{z}(z)}
  , then we can show that for any two random variables 
if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are independent. similarly, the number of ways to pay 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq 0}
   cents in coin denominations of values in the set 
  
    
      
        {
        1
        ,
        5
        ,
        10
        ,
        25
        ,
        50
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{1,5,10,25,50\}}
   (i.e., in pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and half dollars, respectively) is generated by the product

and moreover, if we allow the 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   cents to be paid in coins of any positive integer denomination, we arrive at the generating for the number of such combinations of change being generated by the partition function generating function expanded by the infinite q-pochhammer symbol product of 
  
    
      
        
          ∏
          
            n
            ≥
            1
          
        
        
          
            (
            
              1
              −
              
                z
                
                  n
                
              
            
            )
          
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle \prod _{n\geq 1}\left(1-z^{n}\right)^{-1}}
  .


==== example: the generating function for the catalan numbers ====
an example where convolutions of generating functions are useful allows us to solve for a specific closed-form function representing the ordinary generating function for the catalan numbers, 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{n}}
  . in particular, this sequence has the combinatorial interpretation as being the number of ways to insert parentheses into the product 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ⋅
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ⋯
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}\cdot x_{1}\cdots x_{n}}
   so that the order of multiplication is completely specified. for example, 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            2
          
        
        =
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{2}=2}
   which corresponds to the two expressions 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ⋅
        (
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ⋅
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}\cdot (x_{1}\cdot x_{2})}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ⋅
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        )
        ⋅
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x_{0}\cdot x_{1})\cdot x_{2}}
  . it follows that the sequence satisfies a recurrence relation given by

and so has a corresponding convolved generating function, 
  
    
      
        c
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c(z)}
  , satisfying

since 
  
    
      
        c
        (
        0
        )
        =
        1
        ≠
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle c(0)=1\neq \infty }
  , we then arrive at a formula for this generating function given by

note that the first equation implicitly defining 
  
    
      
        c
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c(z)}
   above implies that

which then leads to another "simple" (as in of form) continued fraction expansion of this generating function.

  .
as an observation, we may approach the question by counting the number of ways to join adjacent sets of vertices. for example, when 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        4

from which we are able to extract an exact formula for the sequence by taking the partial fraction expansion of the last generating function.


=== implicit generating functions and the lagrange inversion formula ===


=== introducing a free parameter (snake oil method) ===
sometimes the sum 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{n}}
   is complicated, and it is not always easy to evaluate. the "free parameter" method is another method (called "snake oil" by h. wilf) to evaluate these sums.
both methods discussed so far have 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   as limit in the summation. when n does not appear explicitly in the summation, we may consider 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   as a “free” parameter and treat 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{n}}
   as a coefficient of 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        ∑
        
          
            s
            
              n
            
          
          
            z
            
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle f(z)=\sum {s_{n}z^{n}}}
  , change the order of the summations on 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   and 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  , and try to compute the inner sum.
for example, if we want to compute

we can treat 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   as a "free" parameter, and set

interchanging summation (“snake oil”) gives

now the inner sum is 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              z
              
                m
                +
                2
                k
              
            
            
              (
              1
              −
              z
              
                )
                
                  m
                  +
                  2
                  k
                  +
                  1
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {z^{m+2k}}{(1-z)^{m+2k+1}}}}
  . thus

then we obtain

it is instructive to use the same method again for the sum, but this time take 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   as the free parameter instead of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  . we thus set

interchanging summation ("snake oil") gives

now the inner sum is 
  
    
      
        (
        1
        +
        z
        
          )
          
            n
            +
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (1+z)^{n+k}}
  . thus

thus we obtain

for 
  
    
      
        m
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\geq 1}
   as before.

  , written

  , i.e.,

            n

          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{n}\equiv b_{n}{\pmod {m}}}
   for all relevant cases of the integers 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   (note that we need not assume that 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is an integer here—it may very well be polynomial-valued in some indeterminate 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , for example). if the "simpler" right-hand-side generating function, 
  
    
      
        b
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle b(z)}
  , is a rational function of 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  , then the form of this sequences suggests that the sequence is eventually periodic modulo fixed particular cases of integer-valued 
  
    
      
        m

        2

        3
      
    
    {\displaystyle 3}
  :
one of the most useful, if not downright powerful, methods of obtaining congruences for sequences enumerated by special generating functions modulo any integers (i.e., not only prime powers 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{k}}
  ) is given in the section on continued fraction representations of (even non-convergent) ordinary generating functions by j-fractions above. we cite one particular result related to generating series expanded through a representation by continued fraction from lando's lectures on generating functions as follows:

generating functions also have other uses in proving congruences for their coefficients. we cite the next two specific examples deriving special case congruences for the stirling numbers of the first kind and for the partition function (mathematics) 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(n)}
   which show the versatility of generating functions in tackling problems involving integer sequences.


==== the stirling numbers modulo small integers ====
the main article on the stirling numbers generated by the finite products

provides an overview of the congruences for these numbers derived strictly from properties of their generating function as in section 4.6 of wilf's stock reference generatingfunctionology.
we repeat the basic argument and notice that when reduces modulo 
  
    
      
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2}
  , these finite product generating functions each satisfy

which implies that the parity of these stirling numbers matches that of the binomial coefficient

and consequently shows that 
  
    
      
        
          [
          
            
              
                
                  
                    n
                  
                
                
                  
                    k
                  
                
              
            
          
          ]
        
      
    
    {\textstyle \left[{\begin{smallmatrix}n\\k\end{smallmatrix}}\right]}
   is even whenever 
  
    
      
        k
        <
        
          ⌈

          ⌉
        
      
    
    {\textstyle k<\left\lceil {\frac {n}{2}}\right\rceil }
  .
similarly, we can reduce the right-hand-side products defining the stirling number generating functions modulo 
  
    
      
        3
      
    
    {\displaystyle 3}
   to obtain slightly more complicated expressions providing that


==== congruences for the partition function ====
in this example, we pull in some of the machinery of infinite products whose power series expansions generate the expansions of many special functions and enumerate partition functions. in particular, we recall that the partition function 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(n)}
   is generated by the reciprocal infinite q-pochhammer symbol product (or z-pochhammer product as the case may be) given by

this partition function satisfies many known congruence properties, which notably include the following results though there are still many open questions about the forms of related integer congruences for the function:
we show how to use generating functions and manipulations of congruences for formal power series to give a highly elementary proof of the first of these congruences listed above.
first, we observe that the binomial coefficient generating function, 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        (
        1
        −
        z
        
          )
          
            5
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/(1-z)^{5}}
  , satisfies that each of its coefficients are divisible by 
  
    
      
        5
      
    
    {\displaystyle 5}
   with the exception of those which correspond to the powers of 
  
    
      
        1
        ,
        
          z
          
            5
          
        
        ,
        
          z
          
            10
          
        
        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1,z^{5},z^{10},\ldots }
  , all of which otherwise have a remainder of 
  
    
      
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1}
   modulo 
  
    
      
        5
      
    
    {\displaystyle 5}
  . thus we may write

which in particular shows us that

hence, we easily see that 
  
    
      
        5
      
    
    {\displaystyle 5}
   divides each coefficient of 
  
    
      
        
          z

=== transformations of generating functions ===
there are a number of transformations of generating functions that provide other applications (see the main article). a transformation of a sequence's ordinary generating function (ogf) provides a method of converting the generating function for one sequence into a generating function enumerating another. these transformations typically involve integral formulas involving a sequence ogf (see integral transformations) or weighted sums over the higher-order derivatives of these functions (see derivative transformations).
generating function transformations can come into play when we seek to express a generating function for the sums

in the form of 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        z
        )
        =
        g
        (
        z
        )
        a
        (
        f
        (
        z
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(z)=g(z)a(f(z))}
   involving the original sequence generating function. for example, if the sums 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            n
          
        
        :=
        
          ∑
          
            k
            ≥
            0
          
        
        
          
            
              (
            
            
              
                n
                +
                k
              
              
                m
                +
                2
                k
              
            
            
              )
            
          
        
        
          a
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle s_{n}:=\sum _{k\geq 0}{\binom {n+k}{m+2k}}a_{k}}
  , then the generating function for the modified sum expressions is given by 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        z
        )
        =
        
          
            
              z
              
                m
              
            
            
              (
              1
              −
              z
              
                )

                  1
                
              
            
          
        
        a
        
          (
          
            
              z
              
                (
                1
                −
                z
                
                  )

    {\textstyle s(z)={\frac {z^{m}}{(1-z)^{m+1}}}a\left({\frac {z}{(1-z)^{2}}}\right)}
    (see also the binomial transform and the stirling transform).
there are also integral formulas for converting between a sequence's ogf, 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)}
  , and its exponential generating function, or egf, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              f
              ^
            
          
        
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\widehat {f}}(z)}
  , and vice versa given by

provided that these integrals converge for appropriate values of 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  .


=== other applications ===
generating functions are used to:

find a closed formula for a sequence given in a recurrence relation. for example, consider fibonacci numbers.
find recurrence relations for sequences—the form of a generating function may suggest a recurrence formula.
find relationships between sequences—if the generating functions of two sequences have a similar form, then the sequences themselves may be related.
explore the asymptotic behaviour of sequences.
prove identities involving sequences.
solve enumeration problems in combinatorics and encoding their solutions. rook polynomials are an example of an application in combinatorics.
evaluate infinite sums.

=== convolution polynomials ===
knuth's article titled "convolution polynomials" defines a generalized class of convolution polynomial sequences by their special generating functions of the form

for some analytic function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   with a power series expansion such that 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        0
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(0)=1}
  .
we say that a family of polynomials, 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          f
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{0},f_{1},f_{2},\ldots }
  , forms a convolution family if 
  
    
      
        deg
        ⁡
        {
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        }
        ≤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle \deg\{f_{n}\}\leq n}
   and if the following convolution condition holds for all 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y}
   and for all 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq 0}
  :

we see that for non-identically zero convolution families, this definition is equivalent to requiring that the sequence have an ordinary generating function of the first form given above.
a sequence of convolution polynomials defined in the notation above has the following properties:

the sequence 
  
    
      
        n

        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle n!\cdot f_{n}(x)}
   is of binomial type
special values of the sequence include

moreover, we can use matrix methods (as in the reference) to prove that given two convolution polynomial sequences,

=== tables of special generating functions ===
an initial listing of special mathematical series is found here. a number of useful and special sequence generating functions are found in section 5.4 and 7.4 of concrete mathematics and in section 2.5 of wilf's generatingfunctionology. other special generating functions of note include the entries in the next table, which is by no means complete.


== history ==
george pólya writes in mathematics and plausible reasoning:

the name "generating function" is due to laplace. yet, without giving it a name, euler used the device of generating functions long before laplace [..]. he applied this mathematical tool to several problems in combinatory analysis and the theory of numbers.
