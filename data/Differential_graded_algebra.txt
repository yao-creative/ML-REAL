in mathematics, in particular abstract algebra and topology, a differential graded algebra is a graded algebra with an added chain complex structure that respects the algebra structure.


== definition ==
a differential graded algebra (or simply dg-algebra) a is a graded algebra equipped with a map 
  
    
      
        d
        :
        a
        →
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\colon a\to a}
   which has either degree 1 (cochain complex convention) or degree −1 (chain complex convention) that satisfies two conditions:

a more succinct way to state the same definition is to say that a dg-algebra is a monoid object in the monoidal category of chain complexes.
a dg morphism between dg-algebras is a graded algebra homomorphism which respects the differential d.
a differential graded augmented algebra (also called a dga-algebra,
an augmented dg-algebra or simply a dga) is a dg-algebra equipped with a dg morphism to the ground ring (the terminology is due to henri cartan).warning: some sources use the term dga for a dg-algebra.

=== tensor algebra ===
the tensor algebra is a dg-algebra with differential similar to that of the koszul complex. for a vector space 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   over a field 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   there is a graded vector space 
  
    
      
        t
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle t(v)}
   defined as

  
    
      
        t
        (
        v
        )
        =

        )
        =

            ⊗
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t(v)=\bigoplus _{i\geq 0}t^{i}(v)=\bigoplus _{i\geq 0}v^{\otimes i}}
  where

    {\displaystyle d}
   on the tensor algebra defined component-wise

  
    
      
        d
        :
        
          t

  sending basis elements to

        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            1
            ≤
            j
            ≤
            k
          
        
        
          e

                1
              
            
          
        
        ⊗
        ⋯
        ⊗
        d
        (
        
          e

  in particular we have 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        
          e

    {\displaystyle d(e_{i})=(-1)^{i}}
   and so

  
    
      
        d

=== koszul complex ===
one of the foundational examples of a differential graded algebra, widely used in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, is the koszul complex. this is because of its wide array of applications, including constructing flat resolutions of complete intersections, and from a derived perspective, they give the derived algebra representing a derived critical locus.


=== de-rham algebra ===
differential forms on a manifold, together with the exterior derivation and the exterior product form a dg-algebra. these have wide applications, including in derived deformation theory. see also de rham cohomology.


=== singular cohomology ===
the singular cohomology of a topological space with coefficients in 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
        
          /

          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} /p\mathbb {z} }
   is a dg-algebra: the differential is given by the bockstein homomorphism associated to the short exact sequence 
  
    
      
        0
        →
        
          z
        
        
          /

          /
        
        
          p
          
            2

          /

          z
        
        →
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\to \mathbb {z} /p\mathbb {z} \to \mathbb {z} /p^{2}\mathbb {z} \to \mathbb {z} /p\mathbb {z} \to 0}
  , and the product is given by the cup product. this differential graded algebra was used to help compute the cohomology of eilenberg–maclane spaces in the cartan seminar.
