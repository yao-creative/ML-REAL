in mathematics, an inner product space (or, rarely, a hausdorff pre-hilbert space) is a real vector space or a complex vector space with an operation called an inner product.  the inner product of two vectors in the space is a scalar, often denoted with angle brackets such as in 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        a
        ,
        b
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle a,b\rangle }
  . inner products allow formal definitions of intuitive geometric notions, such as lengths, angles, and orthogonality (zero inner product) of vectors. inner product spaces generalize euclidean vector spaces, in which the inner product is the dot product or scalar product of cartesian coordinates. inner product spaces of infinite dimension are widely used in functional analysis. inner product spaces over the field of complex numbers are sometimes referred to as unitary spaces. the first usage of the concept of a vector space with an inner product is due to giuseppe peano, in 1898.an inner product naturally induces an associated norm, (denoted 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        x
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |x|}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        y
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |y|}
   in the picture); so, every inner product space is a normed vector space. if this normed space is also complete (that is, a banach space) then the inner product space is a hilbert space. if an inner product space h is not a hilbert space, it can be extended by completion to a hilbert space 
  
    
      
        
          
            h
            ¯
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {h}}.}
   this means that 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is a linear subspace of 
  
    
      
        
          
            h
            ¯
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {h}},}
   the inner product of 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is the restriction of that of 
  
    
      
        
          
            h
            ¯
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {h}},}
   and 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is dense in 
  
    
      
        
          
            h
            ¯

   for the topology defined by the norm.


== definition ==
in this article, f denotes a field that is either the real numbers 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ,}
   or the complex numbers 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} .}
   a scalar is thus an element of f. a bar over an expression representing a scalar denotes the complex conjugate of this scalar. a zero vector is denoted 
  
    
      
        
          0
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {0} }
   for distinguishing it from the scalar 0.
an inner product space is a vector space v over the field f together with an inner product, that is a map

        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle :v\times v\to f}
  that satisfies the following three properties for all vectors 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        ∈
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y,z\in v}
   and all scalars

conjugate symmetry:  as

        =

    {\textstyle x={\overline {x}}}
   if and only if x is real, conjugate symmetry implies that 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        x
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle }
   is always a real number. if f is 
  
    
      
        
          r

  , conjugate symmetry is just symmetry.
linearity in the first argument:
positive-definiteness: if x is not zero, then  (conjugate symmetry implies that

        x
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle }
   is real).if the positive-definiteness condition is replaced by merely requiring that

        x
        ⟩
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle \geq 0}
   for all x, then one obtains the definition of positive semi-definite hermitian form. a positive semi-definite hermitian form 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle }
   is an inner product if and only if for all x, if 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        x
        ⟩
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle =0}
   then x = 0.


=== basic properties ===
in the following properties, which result almost immediately from the definition of an inner product, x, y and z are arbitrary vectors, and a and b are arbitrary scalars. 

  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          0
        
        ,
        x
        ⟩
        =
        ⟨

        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {0} ,x\rangle =\langle x,\mathbf {0} \rangle =0.}

        ,
        x
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle }
   is real and nonnegative.

  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        x
        ⟩
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle =0}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          0
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\mathbf {0} .}
  

  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        a
        y
        +
        b
        z
        ⟩
        =
        
          
            a
            ¯
          
        
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        +
        
          
            b

        z
        ⟩
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,ay+bz\rangle ={\overline {a}}\langle x,y\rangle +{\overline {b}}\langle x,z\rangle .}
  this implies that an inner product is a sesquilinear form.

  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        +
        y
        ,

        y

        =

        )
        +
        ⟨
        y

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x+y,x+y\rangle =\langle x,x\rangle +2\operatorname {re} (\langle x,y\rangle )+\langle y,y\rangle ,}
   where 
  
    
      
        re
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {re} }
  denotes the real part of its argument.over 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  , conjugate-symmetry reduces to symmetry, and sesquilinearity reduces to bilinearity. hence an inner product on a real vector space is a positive-definite symmetric bilinear form. the binomial expansion of a square becomes

  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        +
        y
        ,
        x
        +
        y

        =

        x
        ⟩
        +
        2
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        +
        ⟨
        y
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x+y,x+y\rangle =\langle x,x\rangle +2\langle x,y\rangle +\langle y,y\rangle .}
  


=== convention variant ===
some authors, especially in physics and matrix algebra, prefer to define inner products and sesquilinear forms with linearity in the second argument rather than the first. then the first argument becomes conjugate linear, rather than the second.

=== real and complex numbers ===
among the simplest examples of inner product spaces are

   are a vector space over 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   that becomes a real inner product space when endowed with standard multiplication as its real inner product:

the complex numbers 
  
    
      
        
          c

   are a vector space over 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} }
   that becomes a complex inner product space when endowed with the complex inner product
 
unlike with the real numbers, the assignment 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        ↦
        x
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y)\mapsto xy}
   does not define a complex inner product on

        .

=== complex coordinate space ===
the general form of an inner product on 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} ^{n}}
   is known as the hermitian form and is given by

where 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is any hermitian positive-definite matrix and 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            †
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y^{\dagger }}
   is the conjugate transpose of 
  
    
      
        y
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle y.}
   for the real case, this corresponds to the dot product of the results of directionally-different scaling of the two vectors, with positive scale factors and orthogonal directions of scaling. it is a weighted-sum version of the dot product with positive weights—up to an orthogonal transformation.


=== hilbert space ===
the article on hilbert spaces has several examples of inner product spaces, wherein the metric induced by the inner product yields a complete metric space. an example of an inner product space which induces an incomplete metric is the space 
  
    
      
        c
        (
        [
        a
        ,
        b
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle c([a,b])}
   of continuous complex valued functions 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   on the interval 
  
    
      
        [
        a
        ,
        b
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle [a,b].}
   the inner product is

this space is not complete; consider for example, for the interval [−1, 1] the sequence of continuous "step" functions, 
  
    
      
        {
        
          f
          
            k
          
        
        
          }
          
            k
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f_{k}\}_{k},}
   defined by:

this sequence is a cauchy sequence for the norm induced by the preceding inner product, which does not converge to a continuous function.


=== random variables ===
for real random variables 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle y,}
   the expected value of their product

is an inner product. in this case, 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        x
        ⟩
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle =0}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        pr
        (
        x
        =
        0
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pr(x=0)=1}
   (that is, 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=0}
   almost surely), where 
  
    
      
        pr
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pr }
   denotes the probability of the event. this definition of expectation as inner product can be extended to random vectors as well.


=== complex matrices ===
the inner product for complex square matrices of the same size is the frobenius inner product 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        a
        ,
        b
        ⟩
        :=
        tr
        ⁡
        
          (
          
            a
            
              b
              
                
                  h
                
              
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle a,b\rangle :=\operatorname {tr} \left(ab^{\textsf {h}}\right)}
  . since trace and transposition are linear and the conjugation is on the second matrix, it is a sesquilinear operator. we further get hermitian symmetry by, 

finally, since for 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   nonzero, 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        a
        ,
        a
        ⟩
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            j
          
        
        
          
            |
            
              a
              
                i
                j
              
            
            |
          
          
            2
          
        
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle a,a\rangle =\sum _{ij}\left|a_{ij}\right|^{2}>0}
  , we get that the frobenius inner product is positive definite too, and so is an inner product.


=== vector spaces with forms ===
on an inner product space, or more generally a vector space with a nondegenerate form (hence an isomorphism 
  
    
      
        v
        →
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v\to v^{*}}
  ), vectors can be sent to covectors (in coordinates, via transpose), so that one can take the inner product and outer product of two vectors—not simply of a vector and a covector.


== basic results, terminology, and definitions ==


=== norm properties ===
every inner product space induces a norm, called its canonical norm, that is defined by
 
with this norm, every inner product space becomes a normed vector space. 
so, every general property of normed vector spaces applies to inner product spaces. 
in particular, one has the following properties:

absolute homogeneity

for every 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in v}
   and 
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in f}
  
(this results from 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        a
        x
        ,
        a
        x
        ⟩
        =
        a
        
          
            a
            ¯
          
        
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        x
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle ax,ax\rangle =a{\overline {a}}\langle x,x\rangle }
  ).

triangle inequality

for 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y\in v.}
  
these two properties show that one has indeed a norm.

cauchy–schwarz inequality

for every 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        v
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y\in v,}
  
with equality if and only if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are linearly dependent.

parallelogram law

for every 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y\in v.}
  

the parallelogram law is a necessary and sufficient condition for a norm to be defined by an inner product.

polarization identity

for every 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y\in v.}
  
the inner product can be retrieved from the norm by the polarization identity, since its imaginary part is the real part of 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        i
        y
        ⟩
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,iy\rangle .}
  

ptolemy's inequality

for every 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        ∈
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y,z\in v.}
  
ptolemy's inequality is a necessary and sufficient condition for a seminorm to be the norm defined by an inner product.


=== orthogonality ===
orthogonality
two vectors 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are said to be orthogonal, often written 
  
    
      
        x
        ⊥
        y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\perp y,}
   if their inner product is zero, that is, if 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle =0.}

    {\displaystyle s,}

pythagorean theorem
if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are orthogonal, then

this may be proved by  expressing the squared norms in terms of the inner products, using  additivity for expanding the right-hand side of the equation.

the name pythagorean theorem arises from the geometric interpretation in euclidean geometry.

parseval's identity
an induction on the pythagorean theorem yields: if 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            1

is a real number. this allows defining the (non oriented) angle of two vectors in modern definitions of euclidean geometry in terms of linear algebra. this is also used in data analysis, under the name "cosine similarity", for comparing two vectors of data.


=== real and complex parts of inner products ===
suppose that 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle }
   is an inner product on 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   (so it is antilinear in its second argument). the polarization identity shows that the real part of the inner product is

if 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is a real vector space then

and the imaginary part (also called the complex part) of 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle }
   is always 
  
    
      
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0.}
  
assume for the rest of this section that 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is a complex vector space.
the polarization identity for complex vector spaces shows that

    {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle _{\mathbb {r} }}
   would not be the dot product; furthermore, without the complex conjugate, if 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {c} }

          r

   then 
  
    
      
        ⟨

        x

          x

        ∞
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle =xx=x^{2}\not \in [0,\infty )}
   so the assignment 
  
    
      
        x
        ↦
        
          
            ⟨

    {\displaystyle x\mapsto {\sqrt {\langle x,x\rangle }}}
   would not define a norm.
the next examples show that although real and complex inner products have many properties and results in common, they are not entirely interchangeable.
for instance, if 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle =0}
   then 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        y
        
          ⟩
          
            
              r
            
          
        
        =
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle _{\mathbb {r} }=0,}
   but the next example shows that the converse is in general not true.

    {\displaystyle \langle x,ax\rangle =-i\|x\|^{2},}
   which (as expected) is not identically zero.

this definition of orthonormal basis generalizes to the case of infinite-dimensional inner product spaces in the following way. let

is a basis for 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   if the subspace of 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   generated by finite linear combinations of elements of 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is dense in 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   (in the norm induced by the inner product). say that 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is an orthonormal basis for 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   if it is a basis and

if 
  
    
      
        a

using an infinite-dimensional analog of the gram-schmidt process one may show:
theorem. any separable inner product space has an orthonormal basis.
using the hausdorff maximal principle and the fact that in a complete inner product space orthogonal projection onto linear subspaces is well-defined, one may also show that
theorem. any complete inner product space has an orthonormal basis.
the two previous theorems raise the question of whether all inner product spaces have an orthonormal basis. the answer, it turns out is negative. this is a non-trivial result, and is proved below. the following proof is taken from halmos's a hilbert space problem book (see the references).
parseval's identity leads immediately to the following theorem:
theorem. let

    {\displaystyle \left\{e_{k}\right\}_{k}}
   an orthonormal basis of 
  
    
      
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle v.}
   then the map

is an isometric linear map 
  
    
      
        v
        ↦
        
          ℓ

    {\displaystyle v\mapsto \ell ^{2}}
   with a dense image.
this theorem can be regarded as an abstract form of fourier series, in which an arbitrary orthonormal basis plays the role of the sequence of trigonometric polynomials. note that the underlying index set can be taken to be any countable set (and in fact any set whatsoever, provided 
  
    
      
        
          ℓ

    {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}}
   is defined appropriately, as is explained in the article hilbert space). in particular, we obtain the following result in the theory of fourier series:
theorem. let 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   be the inner product space 
  
    
      
        c
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c[-\pi ,\pi ].}
   then the sequence (indexed on set of all integers) of continuous functions

is an orthonormal basis of the space 
  
    
      
        c
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle c[-\pi ,\pi ]}
   with the 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}}
   inner product. the mapping

is an isometric linear map with dense image.
orthogonality of the sequence 
  
    
      
        {
        
          e
          
            k
          
        
        
          }
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{e_{k}\}_{k}}
   follows immediately from the fact that if 
  
    
      
        k
        ≠
        j
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\neq j,}
   then

normality of the sequence is by design, that is, the coefficients are so chosen so that the norm comes out to 1. finally the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, in the inner product norm, follows from the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, this time in the space of continuous periodic functions on 
  
    
      
        [
        −
        π
        ,
        π
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [-\pi ,\pi ]}
   with the uniform norm. this is the content of the weierstrass theorem on the uniform density of trigonometric polynomials.

   a linear isometry (resp. an antilinear isometry) is an isometry that is also a linear map (resp. an antilinear map). for inner product spaces, the polarization identity can be used to show that 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is an isometry if and only if

    all isometries are injective. the mazur–ulam theorem establishes that every surjective isometry between two real normed spaces is an affine transformation. consequently, an isometry 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   between real inner product spaces is a linear map if and only if 
  
    
      
        a
        (
        0
        )
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle a(0)=0.}
   isometries are morphisms between inner product spaces, and morphisms of real inner product spaces are orthogonal transformations (compare with orthogonal matrix).
isometrical isomorphisms: 
  
    
      
        a
        :
        v
        →
        w
      
    
    {\displaystyle a:v\to w}
   is an isometry which is surjective (and hence bijective). isometrical isomorphisms are also known as unitary operators (compare with unitary matrix).from the point of view of inner product space theory, there is no need to distinguish between two spaces which are isometrically isomorphic. the spectral theorem provides a canonical form for symmetric, unitary and more generally normal operators on finite dimensional inner product spaces. a generalization of the spectral theorem holds for continuous normal operators in hilbert spaces.


== generalizations ==
any of the axioms of an inner product may be weakened, yielding generalized notions. the generalizations that are closest to inner products occur where bilinearity and conjugate symmetry are retained, but positive-definiteness is weakened.


=== degenerate inner products ===

if 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is a vector space and 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
        ⋅
        
        ,
        
        ⋅
        
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \,\cdot \,,\,\cdot \,\rangle }
   a semi-definite sesquilinear form, then the function:

makes sense and satisfies all the properties of norm except that 
  
    
      
        ‖
        x
        ‖
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|x\|=0}
   does not imply 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=0}
   (such a functional is then called a semi-norm). we can produce an inner product space by considering the quotient 
  
    
      
        w
        =
        v
        
          /
        
        {
        x
        :
        ‖
        x
        ‖
        =
        0
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle w=v/\{x:\|x\|=0\}.}
   the sesquilinear form 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
        ⋅
        
        ,
        
        ⋅
        
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \,\cdot \,,\,\cdot \,\rangle }
   factors through 
  
    
      
        w
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle w.}
  
this construction is used in numerous contexts. the gelfand–naimark–segal construction is a particularly important example of the use of this technique. another example is the representation of semi-definite kernels on arbitrary sets.


=== nondegenerate conjugate symmetric forms ===

alternatively, one may require that the pairing be a nondegenerate form, meaning that for all non-zero 
  
    
      
        x
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\neq 0}
   there exists some 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   such that 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        ≠
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle \neq 0,}
   though 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   need not equal 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  ; in other words, the induced map to the dual space 
  
    
      
        v
        →
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v\to v^{*}}
   is injective. this generalization is important in differential geometry: a manifold whose tangent spaces have an inner product is a riemannian manifold, while if this is related to nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form the manifold is a pseudo-riemannian manifold. by sylvester's law of inertia, just as every inner product is similar to the dot product with positive weights on a set of vectors, every nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form is similar to the dot product with nonzero weights on a set of vectors, and the number of positive and negative weights are called respectively the positive index and negative index. product of vectors in minkowski space is an example of indefinite inner product, although, technically speaking, it is not an inner product according to the standard definition above. minkowski space has four dimensions and indices 3 and 1 (assignment of "+" and "−" to them differs depending on conventions).
purely algebraic statements (ones that do not use positivity) usually only rely on the nondegeneracy (the injective homomorphism 
  
    
      
        v
        →
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v\to v^{*}}
  ) and thus hold more generally.


== related products ==
the term "inner product" is opposed to outer product, which is a slightly more general opposite. simply, in coordinates, the inner product is the product of a 
  
    
      
        1
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\times n}
   covector with an 
  
    
      
        n
        ×
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\times 1}
   vector, yielding a 
  
    
      
        1
        ×
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\times 1}
   matrix (a scalar), while the outer product is the product of an 
  
    
      
        m
        ×
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\times 1}
   vector with a 
  
    
      
        1
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\times n}
   covector, yielding an 
  
    
      
        m
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\times n}
   matrix. the outer product is defined for different dimensions, while the inner product requires the same dimension. if the dimensions are the same, then the inner product is the trace of the outer product (trace only being properly defined for square matrices). in an informal summary: "inner is horizontal times vertical and shrinks down, outer is vertical times horizontal and expands out".
more abstractly, the outer product is the bilinear map 
  
    
      
        w
        ×
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
        →
        hom
        ⁡
        (
        v
        ,
        w
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle w\times v^{*}\to \hom(v,w)}
   sending a vector and a covector to a rank 1 linear transformation (simple tensor of type (1, 1)), while the inner product is the bilinear evaluation map 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
        ×
        v
        →
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle v^{*}\times v\to f}
   given by evaluating a covector on a vector; the order of the domain vector spaces here reflects the covector/vector distinction.
the inner product and outer product should not be confused with the interior product and exterior product, which are instead operations on vector fields and differential forms, or more generally on the exterior algebra.
as a further complication, in geometric algebra the inner product and the exterior (grassmann) product are combined in the geometric product (the clifford product in a clifford algebra) – the inner product sends two vectors (1-vectors) to a scalar (a 0-vector), while the exterior product sends two vectors to a bivector (2-vector) – and in this context the exterior product is usually called the outer product (alternatively, wedge product). the inner product is more correctly called a scalar product in this context, as the nondegenerate quadratic form in question need not be positive definite (need not be an inner product).
