the theory of causal fermion systems is an approach to describe fundamental physics. it provides a unification of the weak, the strong and the electromagnetic forces with gravity at the level of classical field theory. moreover, it gives quantum mechanics as a limiting case and has revealed close connections to quantum field theory. therefore, it is a candidate for a unified physical theory.
instead of introducing physical objects on a preexisting spacetime manifold, the general concept is to derive spacetime as well as all the objects therein as secondary objects from the structures of an underlying causal fermion system. this concept also makes it possible to generalize notions of differential geometry to the non-smooth setting. in particular, one can describe situations when spacetime no longer has a manifold structure on the microscopic scale (like a spacetime lattice or other discrete or continuous structures on the planck scale). as a result, the theory of causal fermion systems is a proposal for quantum geometry and an approach to quantum gravity.
causal fermion systems were introduced by felix finster and collaborators.


== motivation and physical concept ==
the physical starting point is the fact that the dirac equation in minkowski space has solutions of negative energy which are usually associated to the dirac sea. taking the concept seriously that the states of the dirac sea form an integral part of the physical system, one finds that many structures (like the causal and metric structures as well as the bosonic fields) can be recovered from the wave functions of the sea states. this leads to the idea that the wave functions of all occupied states (including the sea states) should be regarded as the basic physical objects, and that all structures in spacetime arise as a result of the collective interaction of the sea states with each other and with the additional particles and "holes" in the sea. implementing this picture mathematically leads to the framework of causal fermion systems.
more precisely, the correspondence between the above physical situation and the mathematical framework is obtained as follows. all occupied states span a hilbert space of wave functions in minkowski space 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              m

    {\displaystyle {\hat {m}}}
  . the observable information on the distribution of the wave functions in spacetime is encoded in the local correlation operators

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x),x\in {\hat {m}},}
   which in an orthonormal basis 
  
    
      
        (
        
          ψ
          
            i

    {\displaystyle (\psi _{i})}

        )

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\big (}f(x){\big )}_{j}^{i}=-{\overline {\psi _{i}(x)}}\psi _{j}(x)}
  (where 
  
    
      
        
          
            ψ

    {\displaystyle {\overline {\psi }}}
   is the adjoint spinor).
in order to make the wave functions into the basic physical objects, one considers the set 
  
    
      
        {
        f
        (
        x
        )

        x
        ∈
        
          
            
              m
              ^
            
          
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f(x)\,|\,x\in {\hat {m}}\}}
   as a set of linear operators on an abstract hilbert space. the structures of minkowski space are all disregarded, except for the volume measure 
  
    
      
        
          d
          
            4
          
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle d^{4}x}
  , which is transformed to a corresponding measure on the linear operators (the "universal measure"). the resulting structures, namely a hilbert space together with a measure on the linear operators thereon, are the basic ingredients of a causal fermion system.
the above construction can also be carried out in more general spacetimes. moreover, taking the abstract definition as the starting point, causal fermion systems allow for the description of generalized "quantum spacetimes." the physical picture is that one causal fermion system describes a spacetime together with all structures and objects therein (like the causal and the metric structures, wave functions and quantum fields). in order to single out the physically admissible causal fermion systems, one must formulate physical equations. in analogy to the lagrangian formulation of classical field theory, the physical equations for causal fermion systems are formulated via a variational principle, the so-called causal action principle. since one works with different basic objects, the causal action principle has a novel mathematical structure where one minimizes a positive action under variations of the universal measure. the connection to conventional physical equations is obtained in a certain limiting case (the continuum limit) in which the interaction can be described effectively by gauge fields coupled to particles and antiparticles, whereas the dirac sea is no longer apparent.

        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is referred to as the universal measure.
as will be outlined below, this definition is rich enough to encode analogs of the mathematical structures needed to formulate physical theories. in particular, a causal fermion system gives rise to a spacetime together with additional structures that generalize objects like spinors, the metric and curvature. moreover, it comprises  quantum objects like wave functions and a fermionic fock state.

    {\displaystyle \rho ({\mathcal {f}})}

== inherent structures ==
in contemporary physical theories, the word spacetime refers to a lorentzian manifold 
  
    
      
        (
        m
        ,
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (m,g)}
  . this means that spacetime is a set of points enriched by topological and geometric structures. in the context of causal fermion systems, spacetime does not need to have a manifold structure. instead, spacetime 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a set of operators on a hilbert space (a subset of 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
  ). this implies additional inherent structures that correspond to and generalize usual objects on a spacetime manifold.
for a causal fermion system 
  
    
      
        (
        
          
            h

            f

        ρ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {h}},{\mathcal {f}},\rho )}
  ,
we define spacetime 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   as the support of the universal measure,

  
    
      
        m
        :=
        
          supp

            j

    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are lightlike separated.
this notion of causality fits together with the "causality" of the above causal action in the sense that if two spacetime points 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y\in m}
   are space-like separated, then the lagrangian 
  
    
      
        
          
            l
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {l}}(x,y)}
   vanishes. this corresponds to the physical notion of causality that spatially separated spacetime points do not interact. this causal structure is the reason for the notion "causal" in causal fermion system and causal action.

=== connection and curvature ===
being an operator from one spin space to another, the kernel of the fermionic projector gives relations between different spacetime points. this fact can be used to introduce a spin connection

  
    
      
        
          d
          
            x
            ,
            y
          
        
        
        :
        
        
          s
          
            y
          
        
        →
        
          s
          
            x
          
        
        
        
          unitary
        
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle d_{x,y}\,:\,s_{y}\rightarrow s_{x}\quad {\text{unitary}}\,.}
  the basic idea is to take a polar decomposition of 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(x,y)}
  . the construction becomes more involved by the fact that the spin connection should induce a corresponding metric connection

    {\displaystyle \int _{\omega }{\bigg (}\int _{m\setminus \omega }\cdots {\mathcal {l}}(x,y)\,d\rho (y){\bigg )}\,d\rho (x)\,,}

=== bosonic fock space dynamics ===
based on the conservation laws for the above surface layer integrals, the dynamics of a causal fermion system as described by the euler-lagrange equations corresponding to the causal action principle can be rewritten as a linear, norm-preserving dynamics on the bosonic fock space built up of solutions of the linearized field equations. in the so-called holomorphic approximation, the time evolution respects the complex structure, giving rise to a unitary time evolution on the bosonic fock space.

these transformations have the interpretation as local gauge transformations. the gauge group is determined to be the isometry group of the spin scalar product. the causal action is gauge invariant in the sense that it does not depend on the choice of spinor bases.the equivalence principle: for an explicit description of spacetime one must work with local coordinates. the freedom in choosing such coordinates generalizes the freedom in choosing general reference frames in a spacetime manifold. therefore, the equivalence principle of general relativity is respected. the causal action is generally covariant in the sense that it does not depend on the choice of coordinates.
the pauli exclusion principle: the fermionic fock state associated to the causal fermion system makes it possible to describe the many-particle state by a totally antisymmetric wave function. this gives agreement with the pauli exclusion principle.
the principle of causality is incorporated by the form of the causal action in the sense that spacetime points with spacelike separation do not interact.


== limiting cases ==
causal fermion systems have mathematically sound limiting cases that give a connection to conventional physical structures.

   of the causal fermion systems go over to minkowski space. more specifically, one considers a sequence of causal fermion systems (for example with 
  
    
      
        
          
            h

   finite-dimensional in order to ensure the existence of the fermionick fock state as well as of minimizers of the causal action), such that the corresponding wave functions go over to a configuration of interacting dirac seas involving additional particle states or "holes" in the seas. this procedure, referred to as the continuum limit, gives effective equations having the structure of the dirac equation coupled to classical field equations. for example, for a simplified model involving three elementary fermionic particles

=== quantum field theory in minkowski space ===
starting from the coupled system of equations obtained in the continuum limit and expanding in powers of the coupling constant, one obtains integrals which correspond to feynman diagrams on the tree level. fermionic loop diagrams arise due to the interaction with the sea states, whereas bosonic loop diagrams appear when taking averages over the microscopic (in generally non-smooth) spacetime structure of a causal fermion system (so-called microscopic mixing). the detailed analysis and comparison with standard quantum field theory is work in progress.
