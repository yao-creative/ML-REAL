in mathematics, a local martingale is a type of stochastic process, satisfying the localized version of the martingale property. every martingale is a local martingale; every bounded local martingale is a martingale; in particular, every local martingale that is bounded from below is a supermartingale, and every local martingale that is bounded from above is a submartingale; however, in general a local martingale is not a martingale, because its expectation can be distorted by large values of small probability. in particular, a driftless diffusion process is a local martingale, but not necessarily a martingale.
local martingales are essential in stochastic analysis (see itō calculus, semimartingale, and girsanov theorem).
