knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. while inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone.  in precise mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional euclidean space, r3.  two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of r3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

== knots, links, braids ==
knot (mathematics) gives a general introduction to the concept of a knot.
two classes of knots: torus knots and pretzel knots
cinquefoil knot also known as a (5, 2) torus knot.
figure-eight knot (mathematics) the only 4-crossing knot
granny knot (mathematics) and square knot (mathematics) are a connected sum of two trefoil knots
perko pair, two entries in a knot table that were later shown to be identical.
stevedore knot (mathematics), a prime knot with crossing number 6
three-twist knot is the twist knot with three-half twists, also known as the 52 knot.
trefoil knot a knot with crossing number 3
unknot
knot complement, a compact 3 manifold obtained by removing an open neighborhood of a proper embedding of a tame knot from the 3-sphere.
knots and graphs general introduction to knots with mention of reidemeister movesnotation used in knot theory:

conway notation
dowker–thistlethwaite notation (dt notation)
gauss code (see also gauss diagrams)

=== general knot types ===
2-bridge knot
alternating knot; a knot that can be represented by an alternating diagram (i.e. the crossing alternate over and under as one traverses the knot).
berge knot a class of knots related to lens space surgeries and defined in terms of their properties with respect to a genus 2 heegaard surface.
cable knot, see satellite knot  
chiral knot is knot which is not equivalent to its mirror image.
double torus knot, a knot that can be embedded in a double torus (a genus 2 surface).

== invariants and properties ==
knot invariant   is an invariant defined on knots which is invariant under ambient isotopies of the knot.
finite type invariant   is a knot invariant that can be extended to an invariant of certain singular knots
knot polynomial  is a knot invariant in the form of a polynomial whose coefficients encode some of the properties of a given knot.
alexander polynomial and the associated alexander matrix; the first knot polynomial (1923). sometimes called the alexander–conway polynomial
bracket polynomial is a polynomial invariant of framed links. related to the jones polynomial. also known as the kauffman bracket.
conway polynomial uses skein relations.
homfly polynomial or homflypt polynomial.
jones polynomial assigns a laurent polynomial in the variable t1/2 to the knot or link.
