in mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, the spectrum of a bounded linear operator (or, more generally, an unbounded linear operator) is a generalisation of the set of eigenvalues of a matrix.  specifically, a complex number λ is said to be in the spectrum of a bounded linear operator t if 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   is not invertible, where i is the identity operator. the study of spectra and related properties is known as spectral theory, which has numerous applications, most notably the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.
the spectrum of an operator on a finite-dimensional vector space is precisely the set of eigenvalues.  however an operator on an infinite-dimensional space may have additional elements in its spectrum, and may have no eigenvalues.  for example, consider the right shift operator r on the hilbert space ℓ2,

  
    
      
        (
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        )
        ↦
        (
        0
        ,
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x_{1},x_{2},\dots )\mapsto (0,x_{1},x_{2},\dots ).}
  this has no eigenvalues, since if rx=λx then by expanding this expression we see that x1=0, x2=0, etc.  on the other hand, 0 is in the spectrum because the operator r − 0 (i.e. r itself) is not invertible: it is not surjective since any vector with non-zero first component is not in its range.  in fact every bounded linear operator on a complex banach space must have a non-empty spectrum.
the notion of spectrum extends to unbounded (i.e. not necessarily bounded) operators. a complex number λ is said to be in the spectrum of an unbounded operator 
  
    
      
        t
        :
        
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle t:\,x\to x}
   defined on domain 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        t
        )
        ⊆
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(t)\subseteq x}
   if there is no bounded inverse 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        −
        λ
        i
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
        :
        
        x
        →
        d
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t-\lambda i)^{-1}:\,x\to d(t)}
   defined on the whole of 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
    if t is closed (which includes the case when t is bounded), boundedness of 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        −
        λ
        i
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t-\lambda i)^{-1}}
   follows automatically from its existence.
the space of bounded linear operators b(x) on a banach space x is an example of a unital banach algebra.  since the definition of the spectrum does not mention any properties of b(x) except those that any such algebra has, the notion of a spectrum may be generalised to this context by using the same definition verbatim.


== spectrum of a bounded operator ==


=== definition ===
let 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   be a bounded linear operator acting on a banach space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   over the complex scalar field 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} }
  , and 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   be the identity operator on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .  the spectrum of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is the set of all 
  
    
      
        λ
        ∈
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda \in \mathbb {c} }
   for which the operator 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   does not have an inverse that is a bounded linear operator.
since 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   is a linear operator, the inverse is linear if it exists; and, by the bounded inverse theorem, it is bounded.  therefore, the spectrum consists precisely of those scalars 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   for which 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   is not bijective.
the spectrum of a given operator 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is often denoted 
  
    
      
        σ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma (t)}
  , and its complement, the resolvent set, is denoted 
  
    
      
        ρ
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          c
        
        ∖
        σ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho (t)=\mathbb {c} \setminus \sigma (t)}
  . (
  
    
      
        ρ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho (t)}
   is sometimes used to denote the spectral radius of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  )


=== relation to eigenvalues ===
if 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   is an eigenvalue of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  , then the operator 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   is not one-to-one, and therefore its inverse 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        −
        λ
        i
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t-\lambda i)^{-1}}
   is not defined.  however, the inverse statement is not true: the operator 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   may not have an inverse, even if 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   is not an eigenvalue. thus the spectrum of an operator always contains all its eigenvalues, but is not limited to them.
for example, consider the hilbert space 
  
    
      
        
          ℓ
          
            2

    {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}(\mathbb {z} )}

    {\displaystyle t(v)=\lambda v}
   has no solution in this space, since it implies that all the values

=== basic properties ===
the spectrum of a bounded operator t is always a closed, bounded and non-empty subset of the complex plane.
if the spectrum were empty, then the resolvent function

  
    
      
        r
        (
        λ
        )
        =
        (
        t
        −
        λ
        i
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
        ,
        
        λ
        ∈
        
          c
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle r(\lambda )=(t-\lambda i)^{-1},\qquad \lambda \in \mathbb {c} ,}
  would be defined everywhere on the complex plane and bounded. but it can be shown that the resolvent function r is holomorphic on its domain. by the vector-valued version of liouville's theorem, this function is constant, thus everywhere zero as it is zero at infinity. this would be a contradiction.
the boundedness of the spectrum follows from the neumann series expansion in λ; the spectrum σ(t) is bounded by ||t||. a similar result shows the closedness of the spectrum.
the bound ||t|| on the spectrum can be refined somewhat. the spectral radius, r(t), of t is the radius of the smallest circle in the complex plane which is centered at the origin and contains the spectrum σ(t) inside of it, i.e.

  
    
      
        r
        (
        t
        )
        =
        sup
        {
        
          |
        
        λ
        
          |
        
        :
        λ
        ∈
        σ
        (
        t
        )
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle r(t)=\sup\{|\lambda |:\lambda \in \sigma (t)\}.}
  the spectral radius formula says that for any element 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   of a banach algebra,

  
    
      
        r
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          lim
          
            n
            →

            ‖

== spectrum of an unbounded operator ==
one can extend the definition of spectrum to unbounded operators on a banach space x. these operators which are no longer elements in the banach algebra b(x).


=== definition ===
let x be a banach space and 
  
    
      
        t
        :
        
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle t:\,x\to x}
   be a linear operator defined on domain 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        t
        )
        ⊆
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(t)\subseteq x}
  .
a complex number λ is said to be in the resolvent set (also called regular set) of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   if the operator

  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
        :
        
        d
        (
        t
        )
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i:\,d(t)\to x}
  has a bounded everywhere-defined inverse, i.e. if there exists a bounded operator

  
    
      
        s
        :
        
        x
        →
        d
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s:\,x\rightarrow d(t)}
  such that

  
    
      
        s
        (
        t
        −
        λ
        i
        )
        =
        
          i
          
            d
            (
            t
            )
          
        
        ,
        
        (
        t
        −
        λ
        i
        )
        s
        =
        
          i
          
            x
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(t-\lambda i)=i_{d(t)},\,(t-\lambda i)s=i_{x}.}
  a complex number λ is then in the spectrum if λ is not in the resolvent set.
for λ to be in the resolvent (i.e. not in the spectrum), just like in the bounded case, 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   must be bijective, since it must have a two-sided inverse. as before, if an inverse exists, then its linearity is immediate, but in general it may not be bounded, so this condition must be checked separately.
by the closed graph theorem, boundedness of 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        −
        λ
        i
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t-\lambda i)^{-1}}
   does follow directly from its existence when t is closed.  then, just like in the bounded case, a complex number λ lies in the spectrum of a closed operator t if and only if 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   is not bijective.  note that the class of closed operators includes all bounded operators.


=== basic properties ===
the spectrum of an unbounded operator is in general a closed, possibly empty, subset of the complex plane.
if the operator t is not closed, then 
  
    
      
        σ
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma (t)=\mathbb {c} }
  .


== classification of points in the spectrum ==

a bounded operator t on a banach space is invertible, i.e. has a bounded inverse, if and only if t is bounded below and has dense range. accordingly, the spectrum of t can be divided into the following parts:

  
    
      
        λ
        ∈
        σ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda \in \sigma (t)}
   if 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   is not bounded below. in particular, this is the case if 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   is not injective, that is, λ is an eigenvalue. the set of eigenvalues is called the point spectrum of t and denoted by σp(t). alternatively, 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   could be one-to-one but still not bounded below. such λ is not an eigenvalue but still an approximate eigenvalue of t (eigenvalues themselves are also approximate eigenvalues). the set of approximate eigenvalues (which includes the point spectrum) is called the approximate point spectrum of t, denoted by σap(t).

  
    
      
        λ
        ∈
        σ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda \in \sigma (t)}
   if 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   does not have dense range.  the set of such λ is called the compression spectrum of t, denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            
              c
              p
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{\mathrm {cp} }(t)}
  . if 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   does not have dense range but is injective, λ is said to be in the residual spectrum of t, denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            
              r
              e
              s
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{\mathrm {res} }(t)}
  .note that the approximate point spectrum and residual spectrum are not necessarily disjoint (however, the point spectrum and the residual spectrum are).
the following subsections provide more details on the three parts of σ(t) sketched above.


=== point spectrum ===
if an operator is not injective (so there is some nonzero x with t(x) = 0), then it is clearly not invertible. so if λ is an eigenvalue of t, one necessarily has λ ∈ σ(t). the set of eigenvalues of t is also called the point spectrum of t, denoted by σp(t).


=== approximate point spectrum ===
more generally, by the bounded inverse theorem, t is not invertible if it is not bounded below; that is, if there is no c > 0 such that ||tx|| ≥ c||x|| for all x ∈ x.  so the spectrum includes the set of approximate eigenvalues, which are those λ such that t - λi is not bounded below; equivalently, it is the set of λ for which there is a sequence of unit vectors x1, x2, ... for which

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        ‖
        t
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        −
        λ
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        ‖
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\|tx_{n}-\lambda x_{n}\|=0}
  .the set of approximate eigenvalues is known as the approximate point spectrum, denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            
              a
              p
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{\mathrm {ap} }(t)}
  .
it is easy to see that the eigenvalues lie in the approximate point spectrum.
for example, consider the right shift r on 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2

        →
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|rx_{n}-\lambda x_{n}\|={\sqrt {\frac {2}{n}}}\to 0.}
  since r is a unitary operator, its spectrum lies on the unit circle. therefore, the approximate point spectrum of r is its entire spectrum.
this conclusion is also true for a more general class of operators.
a unitary operator is normal. by the spectral theorem, a bounded operator on a hilbert space h is normal if and only if it is equivalent (after identification of h with an

        −
        λ
        i

the peripheral spectrum of an operator is defined as the set of points in its spectrum which have modulus equal to its spectral radius.


=== discrete spectrum ===
the discrete spectrum is defined as the set of normal eigenvalues. equivalently, it can be characterized as the set of isolated points of the spectrum such that the corresponding riesz projector is of finite rank.

== spectra of particular classes of operators ==


=== compact operators ===
if t is a compact operator, or, more generally, an inessential operator, then it can be shown that the spectrum is countable, that zero is the only possible accumulation point, and that any nonzero λ in the spectrum is an eigenvalue.


=== quasinilpotent operators ===
a bounded operator 
  
    
      
        a
        :
        
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle a:\,x\to x}
   is quasinilpotent if 
  
    
      
        ‖
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
        
          ‖
          
            1
            
              /
            
            n
          
        
        →
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lvert a^{n}\rvert ^{1/n}\to 0}
   as 
  
    
      
        n
        →
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\to \infty }
   (in other words, if the spectral radius of a equals zero). such operators could equivalently be characterized by the condition

  
    
      
        σ
        (
        a
        )
        =
        {
        0
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma (a)=\{0\}.}
  an example of such an operator is 
  
    
      
        a
        :
        
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
        (
        
          n
        
        )
        →
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
        (
        
          n
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a:\,l^{2}(\mathbb {n} )\to l^{2}(\mathbb {n} )}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            j
          
        
        ↦
        
          e
          
            j
            +
            1
          
        
        
          /
        
        
          2
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e_{j}\mapsto e_{j+1}/2^{j}}
   for 
  
    
      
        j
        ∈
        
          n
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle j\in \mathbb {n} }
  .


=== self-adjoint operators ===
if x is a hilbert space and t is a self-adjoint operator (or, more generally, a normal operator), then a remarkable result known as the spectral theorem gives an analogue of the diagonalisation theorem for normal finite-dimensional operators (hermitian matrices, for example).
for self-adjoint operators, one can use spectral measures to define a decomposition of the spectrum into absolutely continuous, pure point, and singular parts.


== spectrum of a real operator ==
the definitions of the resolvent and spectrum can be extended to any continuous linear operator 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   acting on a banach space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   over the real field 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   (instead of the complex field 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} }
  ) via its complexification 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            
              c
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{\mathbb {c} }}
  . in this case we define the resolvent set 
  
    
      
        ρ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho (t)}
   as the set of all 
  
    
      
        λ
        ∈
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda \in \mathbb {c} }
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          t
          
            
              c
            
          
        
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t_{\mathbb {c} }-\lambda i}
   is invertible as an operator acting on the complexified space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            
              c
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\mathbb {c} }}
  ; then we define 
  
    
      
        σ
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          c
        
        ∖
        ρ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma (t)=\mathbb {c} \setminus \rho (t)}
  .


=== real spectrum ===
the real spectrum of a continuous linear operator 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   acting on a real banach space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , denoted 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            
              r
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{\mathbb {r} }(t)}
  , is defined as the set of all 
  
    
      
        λ
        ∈
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda \in \mathbb {r} }
   for which 
  
    
      
        t
        −
        λ
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle t-\lambda i}
   fails to be invertible in the real algebra of bounded linear operators acting on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .  in this case we have 
  
    
      
        σ
        (
        t
        )
        ∩
        
          r
        
        =
        
          σ
          
            
              r
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma (t)\cap \mathbb {r} =\sigma _{\mathbb {r} }(t)}
  .  note that the real spectrum may or may not coincide with the complex spectrum. in particular, the real spectrum could be empty.


== spectrum of a unital banach algebra ==
let b be a complex banach algebra containing a unit e. then we define the spectrum σ(x) (or more explicitly σb(x)) of an element x of b to be the set of those complex numbers λ for which λe − x is not invertible in  b.  this extends the definition for bounded linear operators b(x) on a banach space x, since b(x) is a banach algebra.
