in trigonometry, trigonometric identities are equalities that involve trigonometric functions and are true for every value of the occurring variables for which both sides of the equality are defined. geometrically, these are identities involving certain functions of one or more angles. they are distinct from triangle identities, which are identities potentially involving angles but also involving side lengths or other lengths of a triangle.
these identities are useful whenever expressions involving trigonometric functions need to be simplified. an important application is the integration of non-trigonometric functions: a common technique involves first using the substitution rule with a trigonometric function, and then simplifying the resulting integral with a trigonometric identity.

== reflections, shifts, and periodicity ==
by examining the unit circle, one can establish the following properties of the trigonometric functions.


=== reflections ===

when the direction of a euclidean vector is represented by an angle 
  
    
      
        θ
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta ,}
   this is the angle determined by the free vector (starting at the origin) and the positive 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  -unit vector. the same concept may also be applied to lines in a euclidean space, where the angle is that determined by a parallel to the given line through the origin and the positive 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  -axis. if a line (vector) with direction 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   is reflected about a line with direction 
  
    
      
        α
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha ,}
   then the direction angle 
  
    
      
        
          θ
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta ^{\prime }}
   of this reflected line (vector) has the value

the values of the trigonometric functions of these angles 
  
    
      
        θ
        ,
        
        
          θ
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta ,\;\theta ^{\prime }}
   for specific angles 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   satisfy simple identities: either they are equal, or have opposite signs, or employ the complementary trigonometric function. these are also known as reduction formulae.

    in particular, in these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many angles: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors but there are cofinitely many cosine factors.  terms with infinitely many sine factors would necessarily be equal to zero.
when only finitely many of the angles

    {\displaystyle \theta _{i}}
   are nonzero then only finitely many of the terms on the right side are nonzero because all but finitely many sine factors vanish.  furthermore, in each term all but finitely many of the cosine factors are unity.

these can be shown by using either the sum and difference identities or the multiple-angle formulae.

the fact that the triple-angle formula for sine and cosine only involves powers of a single function allows one to relate the geometric problem of a compass and straightedge construction of angle trisection to the algebraic problem of solving a cubic equation, which allows one to prove that trisection is in general impossible using the given tools, by field theory.a formula for computing the trigonometric identities for the one-third angle exists, but it requires finding the zeroes of the cubic equation 4x3 − 3x + d = 0, where 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is the value of the cosine function at the one-third angle and d is the known value of the cosine function at the full angle. however, the discriminant of this equation is positive, so this equation has three real roots (of which only one is the solution for the cosine of the one-third angle). none of these solutions is reducible to a real algebraic expression, as they use intermediate complex numbers under the cube roots.

the product-to-sum identities or prosthaphaeresis formulae can be proven by expanding their right-hand sides using the angle addition theorems. see amplitude modulation for an application of the product-to-sum formulae, and beat (acoustics) and phase detector for applications of the sum-to-product formulae.

== linear combinations ==
for some purposes it is important to know that any linear combination of sine waves of the same period or frequency but different phase shifts is also a sine wave with the same period or frequency, but a different phase shift. this is useful in sinusoid data fitting, because the measured or observed data are linearly related to the a and b unknowns of the in-phase and quadrature components basis below, resulting in a simpler jacobian, compared to that of 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   and

where i is the imaginary unit. substituting −x for x gives us:

these two equations can be used to solve for cosine and sine in terms of the exponential function.  specifically,

these formulae are useful for proving many other trigonometric identities.  for example, that
ei(θ+φ) = eiθ eiφ means that

that the real part of the left hand side equals the real part of the right hand side is an angle addition formula for cosine.  the equality of the imaginary parts gives an angle addition formula for sine.

the following is perhaps not as readily generalized to an identity containing variables (but see explanation below):

degree measure ceases to be more felicitous than radian measure when we consider this identity with 21 in the denominators:

the factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 may start to make the pattern clear: they are those integers less than 21/2 that are relatively prime to (or have no prime factors in common with) 21. the last several examples are corollaries of a basic fact about the irreducible cyclotomic polynomials: the cosines are the real parts of the zeroes of those polynomials; the sum of the zeroes is the möbius function evaluated at (in the very last case above) 21; only half of the zeroes are present above. the two identities preceding this last one arise in the same fashion with 21 replaced by 10 and 15, respectively.
other cosine identities include:
and so forth for all odd numbers, and hence

many of those curious identities stem from more general facts like the following:
and

combining these gives us

        m
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=2m+1}
  ) we can make use of the symmetries to get

the transfer function of the butterworth low pass filter can be expressed in terms of polynomial and poles. by setting the frequency as the cutoff frequency, the following identity can be proved:


=== computing π ===
an efficient way to compute π to a large number of digits is based on the following identity without variables, due to machin. this is known as a machin-like formula:

or, alternatively, by using an identity of leonhard euler:

or by using pythagorean triples:

others include:

generally, for numbers t1, ..., tn−1 ∈ (−1, 1) for which θn = ∑n−1k=1 arctan tk ∈ (π/4, 3π/4), let tn = tan(π/2 − θn) = cot θn.  this last expression can be computed directly using the formula for the cotangent of a sum of angles whose tangents are t1, ..., tn−1 and its value will be in (−1, 1).  in particular, the computed tn will be rational whenever all the t1, ..., tn−1 values are rational.  with these values,

where in all but the first expression, we have used tangent half-angle formulae.  the first two formulae work even if one or more of the tk values is not within (−1, 1).  note that if t = p/q is rational, then the (2t, 1 − t2, 1 + t2) values in the above formulae are proportional to the pythagorean triple (2pq, q2 − p2, q2 + p2).
for example, for n = 3 terms,

for any a, b, c, d > 0.


=== an identity of euclid ===
euclid showed in book xiii, proposition 10 of his elements that the area of the square on the side of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the sides of the regular hexagon and the regular decagon inscribed in the same circle. in the language of modern trigonometry, this says:

ptolemy used this proposition to compute some angles in his table of chords.
