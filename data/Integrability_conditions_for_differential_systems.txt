in mathematics, certain systems of partial differential equations are usefully formulated, from the point of view of their underlying geometric and algebraic structure, in terms of a system of differential forms. the idea is to take advantage of the way a differential form restricts to a submanifold, and the fact that this restriction is compatible with the exterior derivative. this is one possible approach to certain over-determined systems, for example, including lax pairs of integrable systems. a pfaffian system is specified by 1-forms alone, but the theory includes other types of example of differential system. to elaborate, a pfaffian system is a set of 1-forms on a smooth manifold (which one sets equal to 0 to find solutions to the system).

a pfaffian system is said to be completely integrable if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   admits a foliation by maximal integral manifolds. (note that the foliation need not be regular; i.e. the leaves of the foliation might not be embedded submanifolds.)
an integrability condition is a condition on the 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}
   to guarantee that there will be integral submanifolds of sufficiently high dimension.


== necessary and sufficient conditions ==
the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete integrability of a pfaffian system are given by the frobenius theorem.  one version states that if the ideal 
  
    
      
        
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {i}}}
   algebraically generated by the collection of αi inside the ring ω(m) is differentially closed, in other words

  
    
      
        d
        
          
            i
          
        
        ⊂
        
          
            i
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d{\mathcal {i}}\subset {\mathcal {i}},}
  then the system admits a foliation by maximal integral manifolds. (the converse is obvious from the definitions.)


== example of a non-integrable system ==
not every pfaffian system  is completely integrable in the frobenius sense. for example, consider the following one-form on r3 − (0,0,0):

  
    
      
        θ
        =
        z
        
        d
        x
        +
        x
        
        d
        y
        +
        y
        
        d
        z
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta =z\,dx+x\,dy+y\,dz.}
  if dθ were in the ideal generated by θ we would have, by the skewness of the wedge product

  
    
      
        θ
        ∧
        d
        θ
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta \wedge d\theta =0.}
  but a direct calculation gives

  
    
      
        θ
        ∧
        d
        θ
        =
        (
        x
        +
        y
        +
        z
        )
        
        d
        x
        ∧
        d
        y
        ∧
        d
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta \wedge d\theta =(x+y+z)\,dx\wedge dy\wedge dz}
  which is a nonzero multiple of the standard volume form on r3.  therefore, there are no two-dimensional leaves, and the system is not completely integrable.
on the other hand, for the curve defined by

  
    
      
        x
        =
        t
        ,
        
        y
        =
        c
        ,
        
        z
        =
        
          e
          
            −
            t
            
              /
            
            c
          
        
        ,
        
        t
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=t,\quad y=c,\qquad z=e^{-t/c},\quad t>0}
  then θ defined as above is 0, and hence the curve is easily verified to be a solution (i.e. an integral curve) for the above pfaffian system for any nonzero constant c.


== examples of applications ==
in riemannian geometry, we may consider the problem of finding an orthogonal coframe θi,  i.e., a collection of 1-forms forming a basis of the cotangent space at every point with 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          θ
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        
          θ
          
            j
          
        
        ⟩
        =
        
          δ
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \theta ^{i},\theta ^{j}\rangle =\delta ^{ij}}
   which are closed (dθi = 0, i = 1, 2, ..., n).  by the poincaré lemma, the θi locally will have the form dxi for some functions xi on the manifold, and thus provide an isometry of an open subset of m with an open subset of rn.  such a manifold is called locally flat.
this problem reduces to a question on the coframe bundle of m.  suppose we had such a closed coframe

  
    
      
        θ
        =
        (
        
          θ
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          θ
          
            n
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta =(\theta ^{1},\dots ,\theta ^{n}).}
  if we had another coframe 
  
    
      
        φ
        =
        (
        
          ϕ
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          ϕ
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi =(\phi ^{1},\dots ,\phi ^{n})}
  , then the two coframes would be related by an orthogonal transformation

  
    
      
        φ
        =
        m
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi =m\theta }
  if the connection 1-form is ω, then we have

        φ
        =
        ω
        ∧
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\phi =\omega \wedge \phi }
  on the other hand,

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                d
                φ
              
              
                
                =

                m
                )

                =
                (

                =
                (

                .
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d\phi &=(dm)\wedge \theta +m\wedge d\theta \\&=(dm)\wedge \theta \\&=(dm)m^{-1}\wedge \phi .\end{aligned}}}
  but

    {\displaystyle \omega =(dm)m^{-1}}
   is the maurer–cartan form for the orthogonal group.  therefore, it obeys the structural equation

  
    
      
        d
        ω
        +
        ω
        ∧

        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\omega +\omega \wedge \omega =0,}
   and this is just the curvature of m: 
  
    
      
        ω
        =
        d
        ω
        +
        ω
        ∧
        ω
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega =d\omega +\omega \wedge \omega =0.}
  
after an application of the frobenius theorem, one concludes that a manifold m is locally flat if and only if its curvature vanishes.


== generalizations ==
many generalizations exist to integrability conditions on differential systems which are not necessarily generated by one-forms.  the most famous of these are the cartan–kähler theorem, which only works for real analytic differential systems, and the cartan–kuranishi prolongation theorem.  see further reading for details. the newlander-nirenberg theorem gives integrability conditions for an almost-complex structure.
