in descriptive set theory, a tree on a set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a collection of finite sequences of elements of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   such that every prefix of a sequence in the collection also belongs to the collection.

=== trees ===
the collection of all finite sequences of elements of a set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is denoted 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            <
            ω
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{<\omega }}
  .
with this notation, a tree is a nonempty subset 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            <
            ω
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{<\omega }}
  , such that if

  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          x
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n-1}\rangle }
   is a sequence of length 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   in 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  , and if 
  
    
      
        0
        ≤
        m
        <
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq m<n}
  ,
then the shortened sequence 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          x
          
            m
            −
            1
          
        
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{m-1}\rangle }
   also belongs to 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  . in particular, choosing 
  
    
      
        m
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m=0}
   shows that the empty sequence belongs to every tree.


=== branches and bodies ===
a branch through a tree 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is an infinite sequence of elements of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , each of whose finite prefixes belongs to 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  . the set of all branches through 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is denoted 
  
    
      
        [
        t
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [t]}
   and called the body of the tree 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  .
a tree that has no branches is called wellfounded; a tree with at least one branch is illfounded.  by kőnig's lemma, a tree on a finite set with an infinite number of sequences must necessarily be illfounded.


=== terminal nodes ===
a finite sequence that belongs to a tree 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is called a terminal node if it is not a prefix of a longer sequence in 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  . equivalently, 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          x
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        ⟩
        ∈
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n-1}\rangle \in t}
   is terminal if there is no element 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   such that that 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          x
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        ,
        x
        ⟩
        ∈
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n-1},x\rangle \in t}
  .  a tree that does not have any terminal nodes is called pruned.


== relation to other types of trees ==
in graph theory, a rooted tree is a directed graph in which every vertex except for a special root vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, and in which the path formed by following these edges from any vertex eventually leads to the root vertex.
if 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is a tree in the descriptive set theory sense, then it corresponds to a graph with one vertex for each sequence in 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  , and an outgoing edge from each nonempty sequence that connects it to the shorter sequence formed by removing its last element. this graph is a tree in the graph-theoretic sense. the root of the tree is the empty sequence.
in order theory, a different notion of a tree is used: an order-theoretic tree is a partially ordered set with one minimal element in which each element has a well-ordered set of predecessors.
every tree in descriptive set theory is also an order-theoretic tree, using a partial ordering in which two sequences 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   and 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   are ordered by 
  
    
      
        t
        <
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle t<u}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is a proper prefix of 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  . the empty sequence is the unique minimal element, and each element has a finite and well-ordered set of predecessors (the set of all of its prefixes).
an order-theoretic tree may be represented by an isomorphic tree of sequences if and only if each of its elements has finite height (that is, a finite set of predecessors).


== topology ==
the set of infinite sequences over 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (denoted as 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ω
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\omega }}
  ) may be given the product topology, treating x as a discrete space.
in this topology, every closed subset 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ω
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\omega }}
   is of the form 
  
    
      
        [
        t
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [t]}
   for some pruned tree 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  .
namely, let 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   consist of the set of finite prefixes of the infinite sequences in 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  . conversely, the body 
  
    
      
        [
        t
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [t]}
   of every tree 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   forms a closed set in this topology.
frequently trees on cartesian products 
  
    
      
        x
        ×
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\times y}
   are considered.  in this case, by convention, we consider only the subset 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   of the product space, 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ×
        y
        
          )
          
            <
            ω
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x\times y)^{<\omega }}
  , containing only sequences whose even elements come from 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and odd elements come from 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   (e.g., 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        
          y

    {\displaystyle \langle x_{0},y_{1},x_{2},y_{3}\ldots ,x_{2m},y_{2m+1}\rangle }
  ).  elements in this subspace are identified in the natural way with a subset of the product of two spaces of sequences, 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            <
            ω

            ω
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{<\omega }\times y^{<\omega }}
   (the subset for which the length of the first sequence is equal to or 1 more than the length of the second sequence).
in this way we may identify 
  
    
      
        [
        
          x
          
            <
            ω
          
        
        ]
        ×
        [
        
          y
          
            <
            ω
          
        
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [x^{<\omega }]\times [y^{<\omega }]}
   with 
  
    
      
        [
        t
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [t]}
   for  over the product space.  we may then form the projection of 
  
    
      
        [
        t
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [t]}

        p

        =
