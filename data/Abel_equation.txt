the abel equation, named after niels henrik abel, is a type of functional equation which can be written in the form

  
    
      
        f
        (
        h
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        h
        (
        x
        +
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(h(x))=h(x+1)}
  or equivalently, 

  
    
      
        α
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        α
        (
        x
        )
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha (f(x))=\alpha (x)+1}
  and controls the iteration of f.


== equivalence ==
these equations are equivalent. assuming that α is an invertible function, the second equation can be written as

  
    
      
        
          α
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        α
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        )
        =
        
          α
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        α
        (
        x
        )
        +
        1
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha ^{-1}(\alpha (f(x)))=\alpha ^{-1}(\alpha (x)+1)\,.}
  taking x = α−1(y), the equation can be written as

  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          α
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        y
        )
        )
        =
        
          α
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        y
        +
        1
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\alpha ^{-1}(y))=\alpha ^{-1}(y+1)\,.}
  for a function f(x)  assumed to be known, the task is to  solve the functional equation for the function α−1 ≡ h, possibly satisfying additional requirements, such as α−1(0) = 1.
the change of variables sα(x) =  ψ(x), for a real parameter s, brings abel's equation into the celebrated schröder's equation, ψ(f(x)) = s ψ(x) .
the further change f(x) = exp(sα(x)) into böttcher's equation, f(f(x)) = f(x)s.
the abel equation is a special case of (and easily generalizes to) the translation equation,

        =

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega (\omega (x,u),v)=\omega (x,u+v)~,}
  e.g., for 
  
    
      
        ω
        (
        x
        ,
        1
        )
        =
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega (x,1)=f(x)}
  , 

  
    
      
        ω
        (
        x
        ,
        u
        )
        =
        
          α
          
            −

        α
        (
        x
        )
        +
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega (x,u)=\alpha ^{-1}(\alpha (x)+u)}
  .     (observe ω(x,0) = x.)the abel function α(x) further provides the canonical coordinate for lie advective flows (one parameter lie groups).


== history ==
initially, the equation in the more general form

was reported.  even in the case of a single variable, the equation is non-trivial, and admits special analysis.in the case of a linear transfer function, the solution is expressible compactly.


== special cases ==
the equation of tetration is a special case of abel's equation, with f = exp.
in the case of an integer argument, the equation encodes  a recurrent procedure, e.g.,

  
    
      
        α
        (
        f
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        )
        =
        α
        (
        x
        )
        +
        2
         
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha (f(f(x)))=\alpha (x)+2~,}
  and so on,

  
    
      
        α
        (
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        α
        (
        x
        )
        +
        n
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha (f_{n}(x))=\alpha (x)+n~.}
