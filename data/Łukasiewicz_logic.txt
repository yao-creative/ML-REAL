in mathematics and philosophy, łukasiewicz logic ( loo-kə-shev-itch, polish: [wukaˈɕɛvitʂ]) is a non-classical, many-valued logic. it was originally defined in the early 20th century by jan łukasiewicz as a three-valued logic; it was later generalized to n-valued (for all finite n) as well as infinitely-many-valued (ℵ0-valued) variants, both propositional and first-order. the ℵ0-valued version was published in 1930 by łukasiewicz and alfred tarski; consequently it is sometimes called the łukasiewicz–tarski logic. it belongs to the classes of t-norm fuzzy logics and substructural logics.this article presents the łukasiewicz(–tarski) logic in its full generality, i.e. as an infinite-valued logic. for an elementary introduction to the three-valued instantiation ł3, see three-valued logic.


== language ==
the propositional connectives of łukasiewicz logic are
implication 
  
    
      
        →
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightarrow }
  ,
negation 
  
    
      
        ¬
      
    
    {\displaystyle \neg }
  ,
equivalence 
  
    
      
        ↔
      
    
    {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow }
  ,
weak conjunction 
  
    
      
        ∧
      
    
    {\displaystyle \wedge }
  ,
strong conjunction 
  
    
      
        ⊗
      
    
    {\displaystyle \otimes }
  ,
weak disjunction 
  
    
      
        ∨
      
    
    {\displaystyle \vee }
  ,
strong disjunction 
  
    
      
        ⊕
      
    
    {\displaystyle \oplus }
  ,
and propositional constants 
  
    
      
        
          
            0
            ¯
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {0}}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            1
            ¯
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {1}}}
  .
the presence of conjunction and disjunction is a common feature of substructural logics without the rule of contraction, to which łukasiewicz logic belongs.


== axioms ==
the original system of axioms for propositional infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic used implication and negation as the primitive connectives:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                a
              
              
                
                →
                (
                b
                →
                a
                )
              
            
            
              
                (
                a
                →
                b
                )
              
              
                
                →
                (
                (
                b
                →
                c
                )
                →
                (
                a
                →
                c
                )
                )
              
            
            
              
                (
                (
                a
                →
                b
                )
                →
                b
                )
              
              
                
                →
                (
                (
                b
                →
                a
                )
                →
                a
                )
              
            
            
              
                (
                ¬
                b
                →
                ¬
                a
                )
              
              
                
                →
                (
                a
                →
                b
                )
                .
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a&\rightarrow (b\rightarrow a)\\(a\rightarrow b)&\rightarrow ((b\rightarrow c)\rightarrow (a\rightarrow c))\\((a\rightarrow b)\rightarrow b)&\rightarrow ((b\rightarrow a)\rightarrow a)\\(\neg b\rightarrow \neg a)&\rightarrow (a\rightarrow b).\end{aligned}}}
  propositional infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic can also be axiomatized by adding the following axioms to the axiomatic system of monoidal t-norm logic:

divisibility

  
    
      
        (
        a
        ∧
        b
        )
        →
        (
        a
        ⊗
        (
        a
        →
        b
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a\wedge b)\rightarrow (a\otimes (a\rightarrow b))}
  
double negation

  
    
      
        ¬
        ¬
        a
        →
        a
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \neg \neg a\rightarrow a.}
  that is, infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic arises by adding the axiom of double negation to basic t-norm logic bl, or by adding the axiom of divisibility to the logic imtl.
finite-valued łukasiewicz logics require additional axioms.


== real-valued semantics ==
infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic is a real-valued logic in which sentences from sentential calculus may be assigned a truth value of not only zero or one but also any real number in between (e.g. 0.25). valuations have a recursive definition where:

        ∘
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \circ ,}

        )
        =

            ¬

        )
        )
        ,

   and 
  
    
      
        w
        
          (
          
            
              1

by definition, a formula is a tautology of infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic if it evaluates to 1 under each valuation of propositional variables by real numbers in the interval [0, 1].


== finite-valued and countable-valued semantics ==
using exactly the same valuation formulas as for real-valued semantics łukasiewicz (1922) also defined (up to isomorphism) semantics over  

any finite set of cardinality n ≥ 2 by choosing the domain as { 0, 1/(n − 1), 2/(n − 1), ..., 1 }
any countable set by choosing the domain as { p/q | 0 ≤ p ≤ q where p is a non-negative integer and q is a positive integer }.


== general algebraic semantics ==
the standard real-valued semantics determined by the łukasiewicz t-norm is not the only possible semantics of łukasiewicz logic. general algebraic semantics of propositional infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic is formed by the class of all mv-algebras. the standard real-valued semantics is a special mv-algebra, called the standard mv-algebra.
like other t-norm fuzzy logics, propositional infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic enjoys completeness with respect to the class of all algebras for which the logic is sound (that is, mv-algebras) as well as with respect to only linear ones. this is expressed by the general, linear, and standard completeness theorems:
the following conditions are equivalent:

  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is provable in propositional infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic

  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is valid in all mv-algebras (general completeness)

  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is valid in all linearly ordered mv-algebras (linear completeness)

  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is valid in the standard mv-algebra (standard completeness).font, rodriguez and torrens introduced in 1984 the wajsberg algebra as an alternative model for the infinite-valued łukasiewicz logic.a 1940s attempt by grigore moisil to provide algebraic semantics for the n-valued łukasiewicz logic by means of his łukasiewicz–moisil (lm) algebra (which moisil called łukasiewicz algebras) turned out to be an incorrect model for n ≥ 5. this issue was made public by alan rose in 1956.  c. c. chang's mv-algebra, which is a model for the ℵ0-valued (infinitely-many-valued) łukasiewicz–tarski logic, was published in 1958. for the axiomatically more complicated (finite) n-valued łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by revaz grigolia and called mvn-algebras. mvn-algebras are a subclass of lmn-algebras, and the inclusion is strict for n ≥ 5. in 1982 roberto cignoli published some additional constraints that added to lmn-algebras produce proper models for n-valued łukasiewicz logic; cignoli called his discovery proper łukasiewicz algebras.
