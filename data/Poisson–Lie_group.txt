in mathematics, a poisson–lie group is a poisson manifold that is also a lie group, with the group multiplication being compatible with the poisson algebra structure on the manifold. the lie algebra of a poisson–lie group is a lie bialgebra. 
many quantum groups are quantizations of the poisson algebra of functions on a poisson–lie group.


== definition ==
a poisson–lie group is a lie group g equipped with a poisson bracket for which the group multiplication 
  
    
      
        μ
        :
        g
        ×
        g
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu :g\times g\to g}
   with 
  
    
      
        μ
        (
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
        )
        =
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu (g_{1},g_{2})=g_{1}g_{2}}
   is a poisson map, where the manifold g×g has been given the structure of a product poisson manifold.
explicitly, the following identity must hold for a poisson–lie group:

  
    
      
        {
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          f
          
            2
          
        
        }
        (
        g
        
          g
          ′
        
        )
        =
        {
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        ∘
        
          l
          
            g
          
        
        ,
        
          f
          
            2
          
        
        ∘
        
          l
          
            g
          
        
        }
        (
        
          g
          ′
        
        )
        +
        {
        
          f

              g
              
                ′
              
            
          
        
        ,
        
          f
          
            2
          
        
        ∘
        
          r
          
            
              g
              ′
            
          
        
        }
        (
        g
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f_{1},f_{2}\}(gg')=\{f_{1}\circ l_{g},f_{2}\circ l_{g}\}(g')+\{f_{1}\circ r_{g^{\prime }},f_{2}\circ r_{g'}\}(g)}
  where f1 and f2 are real-valued, smooth functions on the lie group, while g and g' are elements of the lie group. here, lg denotes left-multiplication and rg denotes right-multiplication. 
if 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {p}}}
   denotes the corresponding poisson bivector on g, the condition above can be equivalently stated as 

  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
        
        (
        g
        
          g
          ′
        
        )
        =
        
          l
          
            g
            ∗
          
        
        (
        
          
            p
          
        
        (
        
          g
          ′
        
        )
        )
        +
        
          r
          
            
              g
              ′
            
            ∗
          
        
        (
        
          
            p
          
        
        (
        g
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {p}}(gg')=l_{g\ast }({\mathcal {p}}(g'))+r_{g'\ast }({\mathcal {p}}(g))}
  note that for poisson-lie group always 
  
    
      
        {
        f
        ,
        g
        }
        (
        e
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f,g\}(e)=0}
  , or equivalently 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
        
        (
        e
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {p}}(e)=0}
  . this means that non-trivial poisson-lie structure is never symplectic, not even of constant rank.


== example ==
let 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   be any semisimple lie group. choose a maximal torus 
  
    
      
        t
        ⊂
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle t\subset g}
   and a choice of positive roots. 
let 
  
    
      
        
          b
          
            ±
          
        
        ⊂
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle b_{\pm }\subset g}
   be the corresponding opposite borel subgroups, so that 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        
          b
          
            −
          
        
        ∩
        
          b
          
            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=b_{-}\cap b_{+}}
   and there is a natural projection 
  
    
      
        π
        :
        
          b
          
            ±
          
        
        →
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi :b_{\pm }\to t}
  .
then define a lie group 

  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ∗
          
        
        :=
        {
        (
        
          g
          
            −
          
        
        ,
        
          g
          
            +
          
        
        )
        ∈
        
          b
          
            −
          
        
        ×
        
          b
          
            +
          
        
         
        
          
            |
          
        
         
        π
        (
        
          g
          
            −
          
        
        )
        π
        (
        
          g
          
            +
          
        
        )
        =
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{*}:=\{(g_{-},g_{+})\in b_{-}\times b_{+}\ {\bigl \vert }\ \pi (g_{-})\pi (g_{+})=1\}}
  which is a subgroup of the product  
  
    
      
        
          b
          
            −
          
        
        ×
        
          b
          
            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle b_{-}\times b_{+}}
  , and has the same dimension as 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  .
the standard poisson-lie group structure on g is determined by identifying the lie algebra of 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{*}}
   with the dual of 
the lie algebra of 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
  , as in the standard lie bialgebra example.
this defines a poisson-lie group structure on both 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   and on the dual poisson lie group  
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{*}}
  . 
this is the "standard" example: the drinfeld-jimbo quantum group 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            q
          
        
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{q}{\mathfrak {g}}}
   is a quantization of the poisson algebra of functions on the group 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{*}}
  .
note that 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{*}}
  is solvable, whereas 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is semisimple.


== homomorphisms ==
a poisson–lie group homomorphism 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        :
        g
        →
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi :g\to h}
   is defined to be both a lie group homomorphism and a poisson map. although this is the "obvious" definition, neither left translations nor right translations are poisson maps. also, the inversion map 
  
    
      
        ι
        :
        g
        →
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \iota :g\to g}
   taking 
  
    
      
        ι
        (
        g
        )
        =
        
          g
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \iota (g)=g^{-1}}
   is not a poisson map either, although it is an anti-poisson map:

  
    
      
        {
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        ∘
        ι
        ,
        
          f
          
            2
          
        
        ∘
        ι
        }
        =
        −
        {
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          f
          
            2
          
        
        }
        ∘
        ι
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f_{1}\circ \iota ,f_{2}\circ \iota \}=-\{f_{1},f_{2}\}\circ \iota }
  for any two smooth functions 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          f
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{1},f_{2}}
   on g.
