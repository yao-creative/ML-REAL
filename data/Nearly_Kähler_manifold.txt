in mathematics, a nearly kähler manifold is an almost hermitian manifold 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  , with almost complex structure 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  ,
such that the (2,1)-tensor 
  
    
      
        ∇
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nabla j}
   is skew-symmetric. so,

  
    
      
        (
        
          ∇
          
            x
          
        
        j
        )
        x
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\nabla _{x}j)x=0}
  for every vector field 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   on 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  .
in particular, a kähler manifold is nearly kähler. the converse is not true. 
for example, the nearly kähler six-sphere 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            6
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{6}}
   is an example of a nearly kähler manifold that is not kähler. the familiar almost complex structure on the six-sphere is not induced by a complex atlas on 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            6
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{6}}
  .
usually, non kählerian nearly kähler manifolds are called "strict nearly kähler manifolds".
nearly kähler manifolds, also known as almost tachibana manifolds, were studied by shun-ichi tachibana in 1959 and then by alfred gray from 1970 on.
for example, it was proved that any 6-dimensional strict nearly kähler manifold is an einstein manifold and has vanishing first chern class
(in particular, this implies spin). 
in the 1980s, strict nearly kähler manifolds obtained a lot of consideration because of their relation to killing
spinors: thomas friedrich and ralf grunewald showed that a 6-dimensional riemannian manifold admits
a riemannian killing spinor if and only if it is nearly kähler. this was later given a more fundamental  explanation  by christian bär, who pointed out  that
these  are exactly the 6-manifolds for which the corresponding 7-dimensional riemannian cone has holonomy g2.
the only compact simply connected 6-manifolds known to admit strict nearly kähler metrics are 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            6
          
        
        ,
        
          c
        
        
          
            p
          
          
            3
          
        
        ,
        
          p
        
        (
        t
        
          
            c
            p
          
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{6},\mathbb {c} \mathbb {p} ^{3},\mathbb {p} (t\mathbb {cp} _{2})}
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            3
          
        
        ×
        
          s
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{3}\times s^{3}}
  . each of these admits such a unique nearly kähler metric that is also homogeneous, and these examples are in fact  the only compact  homogeneous strictly nearly kähler 6-manifolds.
however, foscolo and haskins recently showed that 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            6
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{6}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            3
          
        
        ×
        
          s
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{3}\times s^{3}}
    also admit strict nearly kähler metrics that are not homogeneous.bär's observation about the  holonomy of riemannian cones might seem to indicate that the nearly-kähler condition is 
most natural and interesting in dimension 6.  this actually borne out by a theorem of  nagy, who proved that any strict,  complete nearly kähler manifold is locally a riemannian product of homogeneous nearly kähler spaces, twistor spaces over quaternion-kähler manifolds, and 6-dimensional nearly kähler manifolds.nearly kähler manifolds are also an interesting class of manifolds admitting a metric connection with
parallel totally antisymmetric torsion.nearly kähler manifolds should not be confused with  almost kähler manifolds.
an almost kähler manifold 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is an almost hermitian manifold with a closed kähler form:

  
    
      
        d
        ω
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\omega =0}
  . the kähler form or fundamental 2-form 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   is defined by

  
    
      
        ω
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        g
        (
        j
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega (x,y)=g(jx,y),}
  where 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is the metric on 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  . the  nearly kähler condition and the almost kähler condition are essentially exclusive: an almost hermitian manifold is both nearly kähler and almost kahler if and only if it is kähler.
