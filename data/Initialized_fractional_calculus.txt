in mathematical analysis, initialization of the differintegrals is a topic in fractional calculus.


== composition rule of differintegral ==
a certain counterintuitive property of the differintegral operator should be pointed out, namely the composition law. although

  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
          
            q
          
        
        
          
            d
          
          
            −
            q
          
        
        =
        
          i
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {d} ^{q}\mathbb {d} ^{-q}=\mathbb {i} }
  wherein d−q is the left inverse of dq, the converse is not necessarily true:

  
    
      
        
          
            d
          
          
            −
            q
          
        
        
          
            d
          
          
            q
          
        
        ≠
        
          i
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {d} ^{-q}\mathbb {d} ^{q}\neq \mathbb {i} }
  


=== example ===
it is instructive to consider elementary integer-order calculus to see what's happening. first, integrate then differentiate, using the example function 3x2 + 1:

  
    
      
        
          
            d
            
              d
              x
            
          
        
        
          [
          
            ∫
            (
            3
            
              x
              
                2
              
            
            +
            1
            )
            d
            x
          
          ]
        
        =
        
          
            d
            
              d
              x
            
          
        
        [
        
          x
          
            3
          
        
        +
        x
        +
        c
        ]
        =
        3
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        +
        1
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}\left[\int (3x^{2}+1)dx\right]={\frac {d}{dx}}[x^{3}+x+c]=3x^{2}+1\,,}
  on exchanging the order of composition:

  
    
      
        ∫
        
          [
          
            
              
                d
                
                  d
                  x
                
              
            
            (
            3
            
              x
              
                2
              
            
            +
            1
            )
          
          ]
        
        =
        ∫
        6
        x
        
        d
        x
        =
        3
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        +
        c
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int \left[{\frac {d}{dx}}(3x^{2}+1)\right]=\int 6x\,dx=3x^{2}+c\,,}
  in which the constant of integration is c. even if it wasn't obvious, the initialization terms ƒ'(0) = c, ƒ''(0) = d, etc. could be used. if we neglected those initialization terms, the last equation would show the composition of integration then differentiation (and vice versa) would not hold.


== description of initialization ==
this is the problem that with the differintegral.  if the differintegral is initialized properly, then the hoped-for composition law holds.  the problem is that in differentiation, we lose information, as we lost the c in the first equation.
in fractional calculus, however, since the operator has been fractionalized and is thus continuous, an entire complementary function is needed, not just a constant or set of constants.  we call this complementary function 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
  .

  working with a properly initialized differintegral is the subject of initialized fractional calculus.
