in the area of mathematics known as functional analysis, a reflexive space is a locally convex topological vector space (tvs) for which the canonical evaluation map from 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   into its bidual (which is the strong dual of the strong dual of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  ) is an isomorphism of tvss. 
since a normable tvs is reflexive if and only if it is semi-reflexive, every normed space (and so in particular, every banach space) 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is reflexive if and only if the canonical evaluation map from 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   into its bidual is surjective; 
in this case the normed space is necessarily also a banach space. 
in 1951, r. c. james discovered a banach space, now known as james' space, that is not reflexive but is nevertheless isometrically isomorphic to its bidual (any such isomorphism is thus necessarily not the canonical evaluation map). 
reflexive spaces play an important role in the general theory of locally convex tvss and in the theory of banach spaces in particular.  hilbert spaces are prominent examples of reflexive banach spaces.  reflexive banach spaces are often characterized by their geometric properties.

a reflexive space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a banach space, since 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}

=== remark ===
a banach space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is reflexive if it is linearly isometric to its bidual under this canonical embedding 
  
    
      
        j
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle j.}
   james' space is an example of a non-reflexive space which is linearly isometric to its bidual. furthermore, the image of james' space under the canonical embedding 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   has codimension one in its bidual.

a banach space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is called quasi-reflexive (of order 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  ) if the quotient 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ′

        d
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle d.}
  


=== examples ===
every finite-dimensional normed space is reflexive, simply because in this case, the space, its dual and bidual all have the same linear dimension, hence the linear injection 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   from the definition is bijective, by the rank–nullity theorem.
the banach space 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{0}}
   of scalar sequences tending to 0 at infinity, equipped with the supremum norm, is not reflexive.  it follows from the general properties below that 
  
    
      
        
          ℓ
          
            1

   are not reflexive, because 
  
    
      
        
          ℓ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell ^{1}}
   is isomorphic to the dual of

    {\displaystyle \ell ^{1}.}
  
all hilbert spaces are reflexive, as are the lp spaces 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            p

        ∞
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1<p<\infty .}
   more generally: all uniformly convex banach spaces are reflexive according to the milman–pettis theorem.  the

        (
        μ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{\infty }(\mu )}
   spaces are not reflexive (unless they are finite dimensional, which happens for example when 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   is a measure on a finite set).  likewise, the banach space 
  
    
      
        c

        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1]}
   is not reflexive.
the spaces

   of operators in the schatten class  on a hilbert space 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   are uniformly convex, hence reflexive, when 
  
    
      
        1
        <
        p
        <
        ∞
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1<p<\infty .}
    when the dimension of 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is infinite, then

    {\displaystyle s_{1}(h)}
   (the trace class) is not reflexive, because it contains a subspace isomorphic to

   (the bounded linear operators on 
  
    
      
        h

    in both cases, the subspace can be chosen to be the operators diagonal with respect to a given orthonormal basis of

if a banach space 
  
    
      
        y

    {\displaystyle x}
   then 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   is reflexive.every closed linear subspace of a reflexive space is reflexive.  the continuous dual of a reflexive space is reflexive.  every quotient of a reflexive space by a closed subspace is reflexive.let 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   be a banach space. the following are equivalent.

the space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is reflexive.
the continuous dual of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is reflexive.
the closed unit ball of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is compact in the weak topology. (this is known as kakutani's theorem.)
every bounded sequence in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has a weakly convergent subsequence.
every continuous linear functional on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   attains its supremum on the closed unit ball in 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   (james' theorem)since norm-closed convex subsets in a banach space are weakly closed, 
it follows from the third property that closed bounded convex subsets of a reflexive space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   are weakly compact.  thus, for every decreasing sequence of non-empty closed bounded convex subsets of 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   the intersection is non-empty.  as a consequence, every continuous convex function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   on a closed convex subset

   such that the set

is non-empty and bounded for some real number 
  
    
      
        t

   attains its minimum value on 
  
    
      
        c
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c.}
  
the promised geometric property of reflexive banach spaces is the following: if 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is a closed non-empty convex subset of the reflexive space 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   then for every 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in x}
   there exists a 
  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in c}
   such that

    {\displaystyle x}
   and points of 
  
    
      
        c
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c.}
    this follows from the preceding result for convex functions, applied to
  
    
      
        f
        (
        y
        )

    {\displaystyle f(y)+\|y-x\|.}
    note that while the minimal distance between 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   the point 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is not.  the closest point 
  
    
      
        c

   is unique when 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is uniformly convex.
a reflexive banach space is separable if and only if its continuous dual is separable.  this follows from the fact that for every normed space 
  
    
      
        y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle y,}
   separability of the continuous dual

            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y^{\prime }}
   implies separability of 
  
    
      
        y

=== super-reflexive space ===
informally, a super-reflexive banach space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has the following property: given an arbitrary banach space 
  
    
      
        y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle y,}
   if all finite-dimensional subspaces of 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   have a very similar copy sitting somewhere in 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   then 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   must be reflexive.  by this definition, the space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   itself must be reflexive.  as an elementary example, every banach space 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   whose two dimensional subspaces are isometric to subspaces of 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          ℓ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\ell ^{2}}
   satisfies the parallelogram law, hence
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   is a hilbert space, therefore 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   is reflexive.  so 
  
    
      
        
          ℓ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}}
   is super-reflexive.
the formal definition does not use isometries, but almost isometries.  a banach space 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}

in a banach space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}

    the notion of ultraproduct of a family of banach spaces

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is super-reflexive when its ultrapowers are reflexive.
james proved that a space is super-reflexive if and only if its dual is super-reflexive.


=== finite trees in banach spaces ===
one of james' characterizations of super-reflexivity uses the growth of separated trees.
the description of a vectorial binary tree begins with a rooted binary tree labeled by vectors: a tree of height 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   in a banach space 
  
    
      
        x

   is a family of

    {\displaystyle 2^{n+1}-1}
   vectors of 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   that can be organized in successive levels, starting with level 0 that consists of a single vector 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∅
          
        
        ,

   the root of the tree, followed, for 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        1
        ,
        …
        ,
        n
        ,

   by a family of

    {\displaystyle k-1.}
    in addition to the tree structure, it is required here that each vector that is an internal vertex of the tree be the midpoint between its two children:

        t
        ,

   the tree is said to be

  -separated if for every internal vertex, the two children are

using the tree-characterization, enflo proved 
that super-reflexive banach spaces admit an equivalent uniformly convex norm.  trees in a banach space are a special instance of vector-valued martingales.  adding techniques from scalar martingale theory, pisier improved enflo's result by showing 
that a super-reflexive space

    {\displaystyle x}
   admits an equivalent uniformly convex norm for which the modulus of convexity satisfies, for some constant

is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces. here the stereotype dual space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ⋆
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\star }}
   is defined as the space of continuous linear functionals 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\prime }}
   endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on totally bounded sets in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (and the stereotype second dual space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ⋆
            ⋆
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\star \star }}
   is the space dual to 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ⋆
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\star }}
   in the same sense).
in contrast to the classical reflexive spaces the class ste of stereotype spaces is very wide (it contains, in particular, all fréchet spaces and thus, all banach spaces), it forms a closed monoidal category, and it admits standard operations (defined inside of ste) of constructing new spaces, like taking closed subspaces, quotient spaces, projective and injective limits, the space of operators, tensor products, etc. the category ste have applications in duality theory for non-commutative groups.
similarly, one can replace the class of bounded (and totally bounded) subsets in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in the definition of dual space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ′
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\prime },}
   by other classes of subsets, for example, by the class of compact subsets in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   – the spaces defined by the corresponding reflexivity condition are called reflective, and they form an even wider class than ste, but it is not clear (2012), whether this class forms a category with properties similar to those of ste.
