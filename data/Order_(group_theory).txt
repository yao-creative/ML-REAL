in mathematics, the order of a finite group is the number of its elements. if a group is not finite, one says that its order is infinite. the order of an element of a group (also called period length or period) is the order of the subgroup generated by the element. if the group operation is denoted as a multiplication, the order of an element a of a group, is thus the smallest positive integer m such that am = e, where e denotes the identity element of the group, and am denotes the product of m copies of a. if no such m exists, the order of a is infinite. 
the order of a group g is denoted by ord(g) or |g|, and the order of an element a is denoted by ord(a) or |a|, instead of 
  
    
      
        ord
        ⁡
        (
        ⟨
        a
        ⟩
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ord} (\langle a\rangle ),}
   where the brackets denote the generated group.
lagrange's theorem states that for any subgroup h of a finite group g, the order of the subgroup divides the order of the group; that is, |h| is a divisor of |g|. in particular, the order |a| of any element is a divisor of |g|.


== example ==
the symmetric group s3 has the following multiplication table.

this group has six elements, so ord(s3) = 6. by definition, the order of the identity, e, is one, since e 1 = e. each of s, t, and w squares to e, so these group elements have order two: |s| = |t| = |w| = 2. finally, u and v have order 3, since u3 = vu = e, and v3 = uv = e.


== order and structure ==
the order of a group g and the orders of its elements give much information about the structure of the group. roughly speaking, the more complicated the factorization of |g|, the more complicated the structure of g.
for  |g| = 1, the group is trivial. in any group, only the identity element a = e has ord(a) = 1. if every non-identity element in g is equal to its inverse (so that a2 = e), then ord(a) = 2; this implies g is abelian since 
  
    
      
        a
        b
        =
        (
        a
        b
        
          )
          
            −
            1
          
        
        =
        
          b
          
            −
            1
          
        
        
          a
          
            −
            1
          
        
        =
        b
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle ab=(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}=ba}
  . the converse is not true; for example, the (additive) cyclic group z6 of integers modulo 6 is abelian, but the number 2 has order 3:

  
    
      
        2
        +
        2
        +
        2
        =
        6
        ≡
        0
        
          
          (
          mod
          
          6
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2+2+2=6\equiv 0{\pmod {6}}}
  .the relationship between the two concepts of order is the following: if we write

  
    
      
        ⟨
        a
        ⟩
        =
        {
        
          a
          
            k
          
        
        :
        k
        ∈
        
          z
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle a\rangle =\{a^{k}\colon k\in \mathbb {z} \}}
  for the subgroup generated by a, then

  
    
      
        ord
        ⁡
        (
        a
        )
        =
        ord
        ⁡
        (
        ⟨
        a
        ⟩
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ord} (a)=\operatorname {ord} (\langle a\rangle ).}
  for any integer k, we have

ak = e   if and only if   ord(a) divides k.in general, the order of any subgroup of g divides the order of g. more precisely: if h is a subgroup of g, then

ord(g) / ord(h) = [g : h], where [g : h] is called the index of h in g, an integer. this is lagrange's theorem. (this is, however, only true when g has finite order. if ord(g) = ∞, the quotient ord(g) / ord(h) does not make sense.)as an immediate consequence of the above, we see that the order of every element of a group divides the order of the group. for example, in the symmetric group shown above, where ord(s3) = 6, the possible orders of the elements are 1, 2, 3 or 6.
the following partial converse is true for finite groups: if d divides the order of a group g and d is a prime number, then there exists an element of order d in g (this is sometimes called cauchy's theorem). the statement does not hold for composite orders, e.g. the klein four-group does not have an element of order four). this can be shown by inductive proof. the consequences of the theorem include: the order of a group g is a power of a prime p if and only if ord(a) is some power of p for every a in g.if a has infinite order, then all non-zero powers of a have infinite order as well. if a has finite order, we have the following formula for the order of the powers of a:

ord(ak) = ord(a) / gcd(ord(a), k)for every integer k. in particular, a and its inverse a−1 have the same order.
in any group, 

  
    
      
        ord
        ⁡
        (
        a
        b
        )
        =
        ord
        ⁡
        (
        b
        a
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ord} (ab)=\operatorname {ord} (ba)}
  there is no general formula relating the order of a product ab to the orders of a and b. in fact, it is possible that both a and b have finite order while ab has infinite order, or that both a and b have infinite order while ab has finite order. an example of the former is a(x) = 2−x, b(x) = 1−x with ab(x) = x−1 in the group 
  
    
      
        s
        y
        m
        (
        
          z
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle sym(\mathbb {z} )}
  . an example of the latter is a(x) = x+1, b(x) = x−1 with ab(x) = x. if ab = ba, we can at least say that ord(ab) divides lcm(ord(a), ord(b)). as a consequence, one can prove that in a finite abelian group, if m denotes the maximum of all the orders of the group's elements, then every element's order divides m.


== counting by order of elements ==
suppose g is a finite group of order n, and d is a divisor of n.  the number of order d elements in g is a multiple of φ(d) (possibly zero), where φ is euler's totient function, giving the number of positive integers no larger than d and coprime to it.  for example, in the case of s3, φ(3) = 2, and we have exactly two elements of order 3. the theorem provides no useful information about elements of order 2, because φ(2) = 1, and is only of limited utility for composite d such as d = 6, since φ(6) = 2, and there are zero elements of order 6 in s3.


== in relation to homomorphisms ==
group homomorphisms tend to reduce the orders of elements: if f: g → h is a homomorphism, and a is an element of g of finite order, then ord(f(a)) divides ord(a). if f is injective, then ord(f(a)) = ord(a). this can often be used to prove that there are no homomorphisms or no injective homomorphisms, between two explicitly given groups. (for example, there can be no nontrivial homomorphism h: s3 → z5, because every number except zero in z5 has order 5, which does not divide the orders 1, 2, and 3 of elements in s3.) a further consequence is that conjugate elements have the same order.


== class equation ==
an important result about orders is the class equation; it relates the order of a finite group g to the order of its center z(g) and the sizes of its non-trivial conjugacy classes:

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        g
        
          |
        
        =
        
          |
        
        z
        (
        g
        )
        
          |
        
        +
        
          ∑
          
            i
          
        
        
          d
          
            i
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |g|=|z(g)|+\sum _{i}d_{i}\;}
  where the di are the sizes of the non-trivial conjugacy classes; these are proper divisors of |g| bigger than one, and they are also equal to the indices of the centralizers  in g of the representatives of the non-trivial conjugacy classes. for example, the center of s3 is just the trivial group with the single element e, and the equation reads |s3| = 1+2+3.
