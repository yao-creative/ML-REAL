in quantum computing, the quantum fourier transform (qft) is a linear transformation on quantum bits, and is the quantum analogue of the discrete fourier transform. the quantum fourier transform is a part of many quantum algorithms, notably shor's algorithm for factoring and computing the discrete logarithm, the quantum phase estimation algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator, and algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem.  the quantum fourier transform was discovered by don coppersmith.the quantum fourier transform can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer, with a particular decomposition into a product of simpler unitary matrices. using a simple decomposition, the discrete fourier transform on

the quantum fourier transform acts on a quantum state, whereas the classical fourier transform acts on a vector. both the vector in the classical case, and the quantum state, can be written as arrays of numbers, in the quantum case a sequence of probability amplitudes. because measurement of the quantum state only results in a single value, not every task that uses the classical fourier transform can take advantage of the quantum fourier transform's exponential speedup.
the best quantum fourier transform algorithms known (as of late 2000) require only

== properties ==


=== unitarity ===
most of the properties of the quantum fourier transform follow from the fact that it is a unitary transformation. this can be checked by performing matrix multiplication and ensuring that the relation 
  
    
      
        f
        
          f
          
            †
          
        
        =
        
          f
          
            †
          
        
        f
        =
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle ff^{\dagger }=f^{\dagger }f=i}
   holds, where 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            †
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{\dagger }}
   is the hermitian adjoint of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  . alternately, one can check that orthogonal vectors of norm 1 get mapped to orthogonal vectors of norm 1.
from the unitary property it follows that the inverse of the quantum fourier transform is the hermitian adjoint of the fourier matrix, thus 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
        =
        
          f
          
            †
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}=f^{\dagger }}
  . since there is an efficient quantum circuit implementing the quantum fourier transform, the circuit can be run in reverse to perform the inverse quantum fourier transform. thus both transforms can be efficiently performed on a quantum computer.

== relation to quantum hadamard transform ==

using the generalized fourier transform on finite (abelian) groups, there are actually two natural ways to define a quantum fourier transform on an n-qubit quantum register. the qft as defined above is equivalent to the dft, which considers these n qubits as indexed by the cyclic group 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
        
          /
        
        
          2
          
            n
          
        
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} /2^{n}\mathbb {z} }
  . however, it also makes sense to consider the qubits as indexed by the boolean group 
  
    
      
        (
        
          z
        
        
          /
        
        2
        
          z
        
        
          )
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\mathbb {z} /2\mathbb {z} )^{n}}
  , and in this case the fourier transform is the hadamard transform. this is achieved by applying a hadamard gate to each of the n qubits in parallel. note that shor's algorithm uses both types of fourier transforms, both an initial hadamard transform as well as a qft.
