in mathematics, hyperbolic functions are analogues of the ordinary trigonometric functions, but defined using the hyperbola rather than the circle. just as the points (cos t, sin t) form a circle with a unit radius, the points (cosh t, sinh t) form the right half of the unit hyperbola. also, similarly to how the derivatives of sin(t) and cos(t) are cos(t) and –sin(t), the derivatives of sinh(t) and cosh(t) are cosh(t) and +sinh(t).
hyperbolic functions occur in the calculations of angles and distances in hyperbolic geometry. they also occur in the solutions of many linear differential equations (such as the equation defining a catenary), cubic equations, and laplace's equation in cartesian coordinates. laplace's equations are important in many areas of physics, including electromagnetic theory, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and special relativity.
the basic hyperbolic functions are:
hyperbolic sine "sinh" (),
hyperbolic cosine "cosh" (),from which are derived:
hyperbolic tangent "tanh" (),
hyperbolic cosecant "csch" or "cosech" ()
hyperbolic secant "sech" (),
hyperbolic cotangent "coth" (),corresponding to the derived trigonometric functions.
the inverse hyperbolic functions are:

area hyperbolic sine "arsinh" (also denoted "sinh−1", "asinh" or sometimes "arcsinh")
area hyperbolic cosine "arcosh" (also denoted "cosh−1", "acosh" or sometimes "arccosh")
and so on.
the hyperbolic functions take a real argument called a hyperbolic angle. the size of a hyperbolic angle is twice the area of its hyperbolic sector. the hyperbolic functions may be defined in terms of the legs of a right triangle covering this sector.
in complex analysis, the hyperbolic functions arise as the imaginary parts of sine and cosine. the hyperbolic sine and the hyperbolic cosine are entire functions. as a result, the other hyperbolic functions are meromorphic in the whole complex plane.
by lindemann–weierstrass theorem, the hyperbolic functions have a transcendental value for every non-zero algebraic value of the argument.hyperbolic functions were introduced in the 1760s independently by vincenzo riccati and johann heinrich lambert. riccati used sc. and cc. (sinus/cosinus circulare) to refer to circular functions and sh. and ch. (sinus/cosinus hyperbolico) to refer to hyperbolic functions. lambert adopted the names, but altered the abbreviations to those used today. the abbreviations sh, ch, th, cth are also currently used, depending on personal preference.

== definitions ==

there are various equivalent ways to define the hyperbolic functions.


=== exponential definitions ===

in terms of the exponential function:
hyperbolic sine: the odd part of the exponential function, that is, 
hyperbolic cosine: the even part of the exponential function, that is, 
hyperbolic tangent: 
hyperbolic cotangent: for x ≠ 0, 
hyperbolic secant: 
hyperbolic cosecant: for x ≠ 0, 


=== differential equation definitions ===
the hyperbolic functions may be defined as solutions of differential equations: the hyperbolic sine and cosine are the unique solution (s, c) of the system

sinh(x) and cosh(x) are also the unique solution of the equation f ″(x) = f (x),
such that f (0) = 1, f ′(0) = 0 for the hyperbolic cosine, and f (0) = 0, f ′(0) = 1 for the hyperbolic sine.


=== complex trigonometric definitions ===
hyperbolic functions may also be deduced from trigonometric functions with complex arguments:

hyperbolic sine: 
hyperbolic cosine: 
hyperbolic tangent: 
hyperbolic cotangent: 
hyperbolic secant: 
hyperbolic cosecant:where i is the imaginary unit with i2 = −1.
the above definitions are related to the exponential definitions via euler's formula (see § hyperbolic functions for complex numbers below).

=== hyperbolic cosine ===
it can be shown that the area under the curve of the hyperbolic cosine (over a finite interval) is always equal to the arc length corresponding to that interval:


=== hyperbolic tangent ===
the hyperbolic tangent is the (unique) solution to the differential equation f ′ = 1 − f 2, with f (0) = 0.

odd and even functions:

hence:

thus, cosh x and sech x are even functions; the others are odd functions.

hyperbolic sine and cosine satisfy:

where c is the constant of integration.


== taylor series expressions ==
it is possible to express explicitly the taylor series at zero (or the laurent series, if the function is not defined at zero) of the above functions.

this series is convergent for every complex value of x. since the function sinh x is odd, only odd exponents for x occur in its taylor series.

this series is convergent for every complex value of x. since the function cosh x is even, only even exponents for x occur in its taylor series.
the sum of the sinh and cosh series is the infinite series expression of the exponential function.
the following series are followed by a description of a subset of their domain of convergence, where the series is convergent and its sum equals the function.

== comparison with circular functions ==

the hyperbolic functions represent an expansion of trigonometry beyond the circular functions. both types depend on an argument, either circular angle or hyperbolic angle.
since the area of a circular sector with radius r and angle u (in radians) is r2u/2, it will be equal to u when r = √2. in the diagram, such a circle is tangent to the hyperbola xy = 1 at (1,1). the yellow sector depicts an area and angle magnitude. similarly, the yellow and red sectors together depict an area and hyperbolic angle magnitude.
the legs of the two right triangles with hypotenuse on the ray defining the angles are of length √2 times the circular and hyperbolic functions.
the hyperbolic angle is an invariant measure with respect to the squeeze mapping, just as the circular angle is invariant under rotation.the gudermannian function gives a direct relationship between the circular functions, and the hyperbolic ones that does not involve complex numbers.
the graph of the function a cosh(x/a) is the catenary, the curve formed by a uniform flexible chain, hanging freely between two fixed points under uniform gravity.


== relationship to the exponential function ==
the decomposition of the exponential function in its even and odd parts gives the identities

and

combined with euler's formula

this gives

for the general complex exponential function.
additionally,


== hyperbolic functions for complex numbers ==
since the exponential function can be defined for any complex argument, we can also extend the definitions of the hyperbolic functions to complex arguments. the functions sinh z and cosh z are then holomorphic.
relationships to ordinary trigonometric functions are given by euler's formula for complex numbers:

so:

thus, hyperbolic functions are periodic with respect to the imaginary component, with period
