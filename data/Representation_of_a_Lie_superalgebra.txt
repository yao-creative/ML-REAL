in the mathematical field of representation theory, a representation of a lie superalgebra is an action of lie superalgebra l on a z2-graded vector space v, such that if a and b are any two pure elements of l and x and y are any two pure elements of v, then

  equivalently, a representation of l is a z2-graded representation of the universal enveloping algebra of l which respects the third equation above.


== unitary representation of a star lie superalgebra ==
a * lie superalgebra is a complex lie superalgebra equipped with an involutive antilinear map * such that * respects the grading and 

[a,b]*=[b*,a*].a unitary representation of such a lie algebra is a z2 graded hilbert space which is a representation of a lie superalgebra as above together with the requirement that self-adjoint elements of the lie superalgebra are represented by hermitian transformations.
this is a major concept in the study of supersymmetry together with representation of a lie superalgebra on an algebra. say a is an *-algebra representation of the lie superalgebra (together with the additional requirement that * respects the grading and l[a]*=-(-1)lal*[a*]) and h is the unitary rep and also, h is a unitary representation of a.
these three reps are all compatible if for pure elements a in a, |ψ> in h and l in the lie superalgebra,

l[a|ψ>)]=(l[a])|ψ>+(-1)laa(l[|ψ>]).sometimes, the lie superalgebra is embedded within a in the sense that there is a homomorphism from the universal enveloping algebra of the lie superalgebra to a. in that case, the equation above reduces to

l[a]=la-(-1)laal.this approach avoids working directly with a lie supergroup, and hence avoids the use of auxiliary grassmann numbers.
