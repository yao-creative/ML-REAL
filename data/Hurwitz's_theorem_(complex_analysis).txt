in mathematics and in particular the field of complex analysis,  hurwitz's theorem is a theorem associating the zeroes of a sequence of holomorphic, compact locally uniformly convergent functions with that of their corresponding limit. the theorem is named after adolf hurwitz.


== statement ==
let {fk} be a sequence of holomorphic functions on a connected open set g that converge uniformly on compact subsets of g to a holomorphic function f which is not constantly zero on g. if f has a zero of order m at z0 then for every small enough ρ > 0 and for sufficiently large k ∈ n (depending on ρ),  fk has precisely m zeroes in the disk defined by |z − z0| < ρ, including multiplicity.  furthermore, these zeroes converge to z0 as k → ∞.


== remarks ==
the theorem does not guarantee that the result will hold for arbitrary disks. indeed, if one chooses a disk such that f has zeroes on its boundary, the theorem fails. an explicit example is to consider the unit disk d and the sequence defined by

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        z
        )
        =
        z
        −
        1
        +
        
          
            1
            n
          
        
        ,
        
        z
        ∈
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{n}(z)=z-1+{\frac {1}{n}},\qquad z\in \mathbb {c} }
  which converges uniformly to f(z) = z − 1. the function f(z) contains no zeroes in d; however, each fn has exactly one zero in the disk corresponding to the real value 1 − (1/n).


== applications ==
hurwitz's theorem is used in the proof of the riemann mapping theorem, and also has the following two corollaries as an immediate consequence:

let g be a connected, open set and {fn} a sequence of holomorphic functions which converge uniformly on compact subsets of g to a holomorphic function f. if each fn is nonzero everywhere in g, then f is either identically zero or also is nowhere zero.
if {fn} is a sequence of univalent functions on a connected open set g that converge uniformly on compact subsets of g to a holomorphic function f, then either f is univalent or constant.


== proof ==
let f be an analytic function on an open subset of the complex plane with a zero of order m at z0, and suppose that {fn} is a sequence of functions converging uniformly on compact subsets to f.  fix some ρ > 0 such that f(z) ≠ 0 in 0 < |z − z0| ≤ ρ. choose δ such that |f(z)| > δ for z on the circle |z − z0| = ρ. since fk(z) converges uniformly on the disc we have chosen, we can find n such that |fk(z)| ≥ δ/2 for every k ≥ n and every z on the circle, ensuring that the quotient fk′(z)/fk(z) is well defined for all z on the circle |z − z0| = ρ.  by  weierstrass's theorem we have 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            k
          
          ′
        
        →
        
          f
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{k}'\to f'}
   uniformly on the disc, and hence we have another uniform convergence:

                  k
                
                ′
              
              (
              z
              )
            
            
              
                f
                
                  k
                
              
              (
              z
              )
            
          
        
        →
        
          
            
              
                f
                ′
              
              (
              z
              )
            
            
              f
              (
              z
              )

  in the above step, we were able to interchange the integral and the limit because of the uniform convergence of the integrand.  we have shown that nk → m as k → ∞.  since the nk are integer valued, nk must equal m for large enough k.
