in string theory, a domain wall is a theoretical (d−1)-dimensional singularity. a domain wall is meant to represent an object of codimension one embedded into space (a defect in space localized in one spatial dimension). for example, d8-branes are domain walls in type ii string theory. in m-theory, the existence of horava–witten domain walls, "ends of the world" that carry an e8 gauge theory, is important for various relations between superstring theory and m-theory.
if domain walls exist, their interactions are hypothesized to emit gravitational waves that would be detectable by ligo and similar experiments.
