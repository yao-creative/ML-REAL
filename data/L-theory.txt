in mathematics, algebraic l-theory is the k-theory of quadratic forms; the term was coined by c. t. c. wall, 
with l being used as the letter after k. algebraic l-theory, also known as "hermitian k-theory",
is important in surgery theory.


== definition ==
one can define l-groups for any ring with involution r: the quadratic l-groups 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{*}(r)}
   (wall) and the symmetric l-groups 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{*}(r)}
   (mishchenko, ranicki).

the distinction between symmetric l-groups and quadratic l-groups, indicated by upper and lower indices, reflects the usage in group homology and cohomology. the group cohomology

the quadratic l-groups:

   and the symmetric l-groups: 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            n

   which is an isomorphism modulo 2-torsion, and which corresponds to the polarization identities.
the quadratic and the symmetric l-groups are 4-fold periodic (the comment of ranicki, page 12, on the non-periodicity of the symmetric l-groups refers to another type of l-groups, defined using "short complexes").
in view of the applications to the classification of manifolds there are extensive calculations of
the quadratic

  . for finite 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  
algebraic methods are used, and mostly geometric methods (e.g. controlled topology) are used for infinite 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  . 
more generally, one can define l-groups for any additive category with a chain duality, as in ranicki (section 1).


=== integers ===
the simply connected l-groups are also the l-groups of the integers, as

        )
        :=

          z
        
        [
        e
        ]
        )
        =
        l
        (
        
          z
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l(e):=l(\mathbf {z} [e])=l(\mathbf {z} )}

        l
      
    
    {\displaystyle l}
   =

    {\displaystyle l^{*}}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          l

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{*}.}
   for quadratic l-groups, these are the surgery obstructions to simply connected surgery.
the quadratic l-groups of the integers are:
