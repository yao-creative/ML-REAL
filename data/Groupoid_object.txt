in category theory, a branch of mathematics, a groupoid object is both a generalization of a groupoid which is built on richer structures than sets, and a generalization of a group objects when the multiplication is only partially defined.


== definition ==
a groupoid object in a category c admitting finite fiber products consists of a pair of objects 
  
    
      
        r
        ,
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle r,u}
   together with five morphisms

== examples ==


=== group objects ===
a group object is a special case of a groupoid object, where 
  
    
      
        r
        =
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=u}
   and 
  
    
      
        s
        =
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=t}
  . one recovers therefore topological groups by taking the category of topological spaces, or lie groups by taking the category of manifolds, etc.


=== groupoids ===
a groupoid object in the category of sets is precisely a groupoid in the usual sense: a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. indeed, given such a category c, take u to be the set of all objects in c, r the set of all arrows in c, the five morphisms given by 
  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        →
        y
        )
        =
        x
        ,
        
        t
        (
        x
        →
        y
        )
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x\to y)=x,\,t(x\to y)=y}
  , 
  
    
      
        m
        (
        f
        ,
        g
        )
        =
        g
        ∘
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle m(f,g)=g\circ f}
  , 
  
    
      
        e
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          1
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e(x)=1_{x}}
   and 
  
    
      
        i
        (
        f
        )
        =
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle i(f)=f^{-1}}
  . when the term "groupoid" can naturally refer to a groupoid object in some particular category in mind, the term groupoid set is used to refer to a groupoid object in the category of sets.
however, unlike in the previous example with lie groups, a groupoid object in the category of manifolds is not necessarily a lie groupoid, since the maps s and t fail to satisfy further requirements (they are not necessarily submersions).


=== groupoid schemes ===
a groupoid s-scheme is a groupoid object in the category of schemes over some fixed base scheme s. if 
  
    
      
        u
        =
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle u=s}
  , then a groupoid scheme (where 
  
    
      
        s
        =
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=t}
   are necessarily the structure map) is the same as a group scheme. a groupoid scheme is also called an algebraic groupoid, for example in (gillet 1984), to convey the idea it is a generalization of algebraic groups and their actions.
for example, suppose an algebraic group g acts from the right on a scheme u. then take 
  
    
      
        r
        =
        u
        ×
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=u\times g}
  , s the projection, t the given action. this determines a groupoid scheme.


== constructions ==
given a groupoid object (r, u), the equalizer of 
  
    
      
        r
        
          
            
              ⇉
              t
            
            s
          
        
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle r{\overset {s}{\underset {t}{\rightrightarrows }}}u}
  , if any, is a group object called the inertia group of the groupoid. the coequalizer of the same diagram, if any, is the quotient of the groupoid.
each groupoid object in a category c (if any) may be thought of as a contravariant functor from c to the category of groupoids. this way, each groupoid object determines a prestack in groupoids. this prestack is not a stack but it can be stackified to yield a stack.
the main use of the notion is that it provides an atlas for a stack. more specifically, let 
  
    
      
        [
        r
        ⇉
        u
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [r\rightrightarrows u]}
   be the category of 
  
    
      
        (
        r
        ⇉
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (r\rightrightarrows u)}
  -torsors. then it is a category fibered in groupoids; in fact, (in a nice case), a deligne–mumford stack. conversely, any dm stack is of this form.
