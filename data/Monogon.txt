in geometry, a monogon, also known as a henagon, is a polygon with one edge and one vertex. it has schläfli symbol {1}.


== in euclidean geometry ==
in euclidean geometry a monogon is a degenerate polygon because its endpoints must coincide, unlike any euclidean line segment. most definitions of a polygon in euclidean geometry do not admit the monogon.


== in spherical geometry ==
in spherical geometry, a monogon can be constructed as a vertex on a great circle (equator). this forms a dihedron, {1,2}, with two hemispherical monogonal faces which share one 360° edge and one vertex. its dual, a hosohedron, {2,1} has two antipodal vertices at the poles, one 360 degree lune face, and one edge (meridian) between the two vertices.
