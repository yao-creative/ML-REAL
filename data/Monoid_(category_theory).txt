in category theory, a branch of mathematics, a monoid (or monoid object, or internal monoid, or algebra) (m, μ, η) in a monoidal category (c, ⊗, i) is an object m together with two morphisms

μ: m ⊗ m → m called multiplication,
η: i → m called unit,such that the pentagon diagram

and the unitor diagram

commute. in the above notation, 1 is the identity morphism of m, i is the unit element and α, λ and ρ are respectively the associativity, the left identity and the right identity of the monoidal category c.
dually, a comonoid in a monoidal category c is a monoid in the dual category cop.
suppose that the monoidal category c has a symmetry γ. a monoid m in c is commutative when μ o γ = μ.


== examples ==
a monoid object in set, the category of sets (with the monoidal structure induced by the cartesian product), is a monoid in the usual sense.
a monoid object in top, the category of topological spaces (with the monoidal structure induced by the product topology), is a topological monoid.
a monoid object in the category of monoids (with the direct product of monoids) is just a commutative monoid. this follows easily from the eckmann–hilton argument.
a monoid object in the category of complete join-semilattices sup (with the monoidal structure induced by the cartesian product) is a unital quantale.
a monoid object in (ab, ⊗z, z), the category of abelian groups, is a ring.
for a commutative ring r, a monoid object in
(r-mod, ⊗r, r), the category of modules over r, is an r-algebra.
the category of graded modules is a graded r-algebra.
the category of chain complexes of r-modules is a differential graded algebra.
a monoid object in k-vect, the category of k-vector spaces (again, with the tensor product), is a k-algebra, and a comonoid object is a k-coalgebra.
for any category c, the category [c,c] of its endofunctors has a monoidal structure induced by the composition and the identity functor ic. a monoid object in [c,c] is a monad on c.
for any category with finite products, every object becomes a comonoid object via the diagonal morphism 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            x
          
        
        :
        x
        →
        x
        ×
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta _{x}:x\to x\times x}
  . dually in a category with finite coproducts every object becomes a monoid object via 
  
    
      
        i
        
          d
          
            x
          
        
        ⊔
        i
        
          d
          
            x
          
        
        :
        x
        ⊔
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle id_{x}\sqcup id_{x}:x\sqcup x\to x}
  .


== categories of monoids ==
given two monoids (m, μ, η) and (m', μ', η') in a monoidal category c, a morphism f : m → m ' is a morphism of monoids when

f o μ = μ' o (f ⊗ f),
f o η = η'.in other words, the following diagrams
, 
commute.
the category of monoids in c and their monoid morphisms is written monc.
