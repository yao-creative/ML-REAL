in mathematics, the hodge star operator or hodge star is a linear map defined on the exterior algebra of a finite-dimensional oriented vector space endowed with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form.  applying the operator to an element of the algebra produces the hodge dual of the element.  this map was introduced by w. v. d. hodge.
for example, in an oriented 3-dimensional euclidean space, an oriented plane can be represented by the exterior product of two basis vectors, and its hodge dual is the normal vector given by their cross product; conversely, any vector is dual to the oriented plane perpendicular to it, endowed with a suitable bivector. generalizing this to an n-dimensional vector space, the hodge star is a one-to-one mapping of k-vectors to (n – k)-vectors; the dimensions of these spaces are the binomial coefficients

        =
        
          
            
              
                (

    {\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}={\tbinom {n}{n-k}}}
  .
the naturalness of the star operator means it can play a role in differential geometry, when applied to the cotangent bundle of a pseudo-riemannian manifold, and hence to  differential k-forms. this allows the definition of the codifferential as the hodge adjoint of the exterior derivative, leading to the laplace–de rham operator. this generalizes the case of 3-dimensional euclidean space, in which divergence of a vector field may be realized as the codifferential opposite to the gradient operator, and the laplace operator on a function is the divergence of its gradient. an important application is the hodge decomposition of differential forms on a closed riemannian manifold.

the hodge star relates the exterior and cross product in three dimensions:
  
    
      
        
          ⋆
        
        (
        
          u
        
        ∧
        
          v

        =
        
          u
        
        ×
        
          v
        
        
        
          ⋆
        
        (
        
          u
        
        ×
        
          v
        
        )
        =
        
          u
        
        ∧
        
          v
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\star }(\mathbf {u} \wedge \mathbf {v} )=\mathbf {u} \times \mathbf {v} \qquad {\star }(\mathbf {u} \times \mathbf {v} )=\mathbf {u} \wedge \mathbf {v} .}
  applied to three dimensions, the hodge star provides an isomorphism between axial vectors and bivectors, so each axial vector a is associated with a bivector a and vice versa, that is: 
  
    
      
        
          a
        
        =
        
          ⋆
        
        
          a
        
        ,
         
         
        
          a
        
        =
        
          ⋆
        
        
          a
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={\star }\mathbf {a} ,\ \ \mathbf {a} ={\star }\mathbf {a} }
  .
the hodge star can also be interpreted as a form of the geometric correspondence between an axis and an infinitesimal rotation around the axis, with speed equal to the length of the axis vector. an inner product on a vector space 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   gives an isomorphism 
  
    
      
        v
        ≅
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v\cong v^{*}\!}

        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}

        l
        :
        v
        →
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle l:v\to v}
   is naturally isomorphic to the tensor product 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
        
        
        ⊗
        v

    {\displaystyle v^{*}\!\!\otimes v\cong v\otimes v}
  . thus for

  , the hodge star acts as an endomorphism of the second exterior power (i.e. it maps 2-forms to 2-forms, since 4 − 2 = 2). if the signature of the metric tensor is all positive, i.e. on a riemannian manifold, then the hodge star is an involution. if the signature is mixed, i.e., pseudo-riemannian, then application twice will return the argument up to a sign – see § duality below. this particular endomorphism property of 2-forms in four dimensions makes self-dual and anti-self-dual two-forms natural geometric objects to study. that is, one can describe the space of 2-forms in four dimensions with a basis that “diagonalizes” the hodge star operation with eigenvalues

hodge dual for three- and four-forms can be easily deduced from the fact that, in the lorentzian signature, 
  
    
      
        (
        ⋆
        
          )

        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\star )^{2}=-1}

        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  , its hodge dual 
  
    
      
        
          ⋆
        
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\star }\alpha }
   may be obtained by writing the components not involved in 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   in an order such that

        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   contains 
  
    
      
        d
        t

        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   involves an odd number of the space-associated forms

and hence deserve the name self-dual and anti-self-dual two-forms. understanding the geometry, or kinematics, of minkowski spacetime in self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors turns out to be insightful in both mathematical and physical perspectives, making contacts to the use of the two-spinor language in modern physics such as spinor-helicity formalism or twistor theory.


=== conformal invariance ===
the hodge star is conformally invariant on n forms on a 2n dimensional vector space v, i.e. if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is a metric on 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   and 
  
    
      
        λ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda >0}
  , then the induced hodge stars

            g
          
        
        ,

    {\displaystyle \star _{g},\star _{\lambda g}\colon \lambda ^{n}v\to \lambda ^{n}v}

=== example: derivatives in three dimensions ===
the combination of the 
  
    
      
        ⋆
      
    
    {\displaystyle \star }
   operator and the exterior derivative d generates the classical operators grad, curl, and div on vector fields in three-dimensional euclidean space. this works out as follows: d takes a 0-form (a function) to a 1-form, a 1-form to a 2-form, and a 2-form to a 3-form (and takes a 3-form to zero). for a 0-form

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f=f(x,y,z)}

  one advantage of this expression is that the identity d2 = 0, which is true in all cases, has as special cases two other identities: 1)  curl grad f = 0, and 2)  div curl f = 0. in particular, maxwell's equations take on a particularly simple and elegant form, when expressed in terms of the exterior derivative and the hodge star. the expression

  -forms. any function

    {\displaystyle \varphi }

        ⋆
        d

    {\displaystyle \delta =-\star d\star }
   and after some plug and chug, one obtains the laplacian acting on

  although one can apply this expression to any tensor 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  , the result is antisymmetric, since contraction with the completely anti-symmetric levi-civita symbol cancels all but the totally antisymmetric part of the tensor.  it is thus equivalent to antisymmetrization followed by applying the hodge star.

  the codifferential is not an antiderivation on the exterior algebra, in contrast to the exterior derivative.
the codifferential is the adjoint of the exterior derivative with respect to the square-integrable inner product:

  
    
      
        ⟨
        
        ⟨

    {\displaystyle \langle \!\langle \eta ,\delta \zeta \rangle \!\rangle \ =\ \langle \!\langle d\eta ,\zeta \rangle \!\rangle ,}
  where 
  
    
      
        ζ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \zeta }
   is a (k + 1)-form and 
  
    
      
        η
      
    
    {\displaystyle \eta }
   a k-form. this property is useful as it can be used to define the codifferential even when the manifold is non-orientable (and the hodge star operator not defined). the identity can be proved from stokes' theorem for smooth forms:

  the hodge star sends harmonic forms to harmonic forms. as a consequence of hodge theory, the de rham cohomology is naturally isomorphic to the space of harmonic k-forms, and so the hodge star induces an isomorphism of cohomology groups
