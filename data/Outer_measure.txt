in the mathematical field of measure theory, an outer measure or exterior measure is a function defined on all subsets of a given set with values in the extended real numbers satisfying some additional technical conditions. the theory of outer measures was first introduced by constantin carathéodory to provide an abstract basis for the theory of measurable sets and countably additive measures. carathéodory's work on outer measures found many applications in measure-theoretic set theory (outer measures are for example used in the proof of the fundamental carathéodory's extension theorem), and was used in an essential way by hausdorff to define a dimension-like metric invariant now called hausdorff dimension. outer measures are commonly used in the field of geometric measure theory.
measures are generalizations of length, area and volume, but are useful for much more abstract and irregular sets than intervals in

  it turns out that these requirements are incompatible conditions; see non-measurable set.  the purpose of constructing an outer measure on all subsets of x is to pick out a class of subsets (to be called measurable) in such a way as to satisfy the countable additivity property.

== measurability of sets relative to an outer measure ==
let x be a set with an outer measure μ. one says that a subset e of x is μ-measurable (sometimes "carathéodory-measurable relative to μ") if and only if

  
    
      
        μ
        (
        a
        )
        =
        μ
        
          
            (
          
        
        a
        ∩
        e
        
          
            )
          
        
        +
        μ
        
          
            (
          
        
        a
        ∖
        e
        
          
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu (a)=\mu {\big (}a\cap e{\big )}+\mu {\big (}a\setminus e{\big )}}
  for every subset a of x.
informally, this says that a μ-measurable subset is one which may be used as a building block, breaking any other subset apart into pieces (namely, the piece which is inside of the measurable set together with the piece which is outside of the measurable set). in terms of the motivation for measure theory, one would expect that area, for example, should be an outer measure on the plane. one might then expect that every subset of the plane would be deemed "measurable," following the expected principle that

  
    
      
        area
        ⁡
        (
        a
        ∪
        b
        )
        =
        area
        ⁡
        (
        a
        )
        +
        area
        ⁡
        (
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {area} (a\cup b)=\operatorname {area} (a)+\operatorname {area} (b)}
  whenever a and b are disjoint subsets of the plane. however, the formal logical development of the theory shows that the situation is more complicated. a formal implication of the axiom of choice is that for any definition of area as an outer measure which includes as a special case the standard formula for the area of a rectangle, there must be subsets of the plane which fail to be measurable. in particular, the above "expected principle" is false, provided that one accepts the axiom of choice.


=== the measure space associated to an outer measure ===
it is straightforward to use the above definition of μ-measurability to see that

if a ⊂ x is μ-measurable then its complement x − a ⊂ x is also μ-measurable.the following condition is known as the "countable additivity of μ on measurable subsets."

if a1, a2, ... are μ-measurable subsets of x and ai ∩ aj is empty whenever i ≠ j, then one has
  
    
      
        μ
        
          
            (
          
        
        
          ⋃
          
            j
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          a
          
            j
          
        
        
          
            )
          
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            j
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        μ
        (
        
          a
          
            j
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu {\big (}\bigcup _{j=1}^{\infty }a_{j}{\big )}=\sum _{j=1}^{\infty }\mu (a_{j}).}
  a similar proof shows that:

if a1, a2, ... are μ-measurable subsets of x, then the union ∪j ∈ 
  
    
      
        
          n
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {n} }
   aj and intersection ∩j ∈ 
  
    
      
        
          n
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {n} }
   aj are also μ-measurable.the properties given here can be summarized by the following terminology:

given any outer measure μ on a set x, the collection of all μ-measurable subsets of x is a σ-algebra. the restriction of μ to this σ-algebra is a measure.
one thus has a measure space structure on x, arising naturally from the specification of an outer measure on x. this measure space has the additional property of completeness, which is contained in the following statement:

every subset a ⊂ x such that μ(a) = 0 is μ-measurable.this is easy to prove by using the second property in the "alternative definition" of outer measure.


== restriction and pushforward of an outer measure ==
let μ be an outer measure on the set x.


=== pushforward ===
given another set y and a map f : x→y, define f# μ : 2y→[0,∞] by

  
    
      
        
          
            (
          
        
        
          f
          
            ♯
          
        
        μ
        
          
            )
          
        
        (
        a
        )
        =
        μ
        
          
            (
          
        
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        a
        )
        
          
            )
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\big (}f_{\sharp }\mu {\big )}(a)=\mu {\big (}f^{-1}(a){\big )}.}
  one can verify directly from the definitions that f# μ is an outer measure on y.


=== restriction ===
let b be a subset of x. define μb : 2x→[0,∞] by

  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            b
          
        
        (
        a
        )
        =
        μ
        (
        a
        ∩
        b
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{b}(a)=\mu (a\cap b).}
  one can check directly from the definitions that μb is another outer measure on x.


=== measurability of sets relative to a pushforward or restriction ===
if a subset a of x is μ-measurable, then it is also μb-measurable for any subset b of x.
given a map f : x→y and a subset a of y, if f −1(a) is μ-measurable then a is f# μ-measurable. more generally, f −1(a) is μ-measurable if and only if a is f# (μb)-measurable for every subset b of x.


== regular outer measures ==


=== definition of a regular outer measure ===
given a set x, an outer measure μ on x is said to be regular if any subset can be approximated 'from the outside' by μ-measurable sets. formally, this is requiring either of the following equivalent conditions:

for any subset a of x and any positive number ε, there exists a μ-measurable subset b of x which contains a and with μ(b) < μ(a) + ε.
for any subset a of x, there exists a μ-measurable subset b of x which contains a and such that μ(b) = μ(a).it is automatic that the second condition implies the first; the first implies the second by considering the intersection of a minimizing sequence of subsets.


=== the regular outer measure associated to an outer measure ===
given an outer measure μ on a set x, define ν : 2x→[0,∞] by

  
    
      
        ν
        (
        a
        )
        =
        inf
        
          
            {
          
        
        μ
        (
        b
        )
        :
        μ
        
          -measurable subsets 
        
        b
        ⊂
        x
        
           with 
        
        b
        ⊃
        a
        
          
            }
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \nu (a)=\inf {\big \{}\mu (b):\mu {\text{-measurable subsets }}b\subset x{\text{ with }}b\supset a{\big \}}.}
  then ν is a regular outer measure on x which assigns the same measure as μ to all μ-measurable subsets of x. every μ-measurable subset is also ν-measurable, and every ν-measurable subset of finite ν-measure is also μ-measurable.
so the measure space associated to ν may have a larger σ-algebra than the measure space associated to μ. the restrictions of ν and μ to the smaller σ-algebra are identical. the elements of the larger σ-algebra which are not contained in the smaller σ-algebra have infinite ν-measure and finite μ-measure.
from this perspective, ν may be regarded as an extension of μ.

theorem. if φ is a metric outer measure on x,  then every borel subset of x is φ-measurable. (the borel sets of x are the elements of the smallest σ-algebra generated by the open sets.)


== construction of outer measures ==

there are several procedures for constructing outer measures on  a set.  the classic munroe reference below describes two particularly useful ones which are referred to as method i and method ii.


=== method i ===
let x be a set, c a family of subsets of x which contains the empty set and p a non-negative extended real valued function on c which vanishes on the empty set.
theorem. suppose the family c and the function p are as above and  define

  
    
      
        φ
        (
        e
        )
        =
        inf
        
          
            {
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        p
        (
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        )
        
        
          
            |
          
        
        
        e
        ⊆
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        ∀
        i
        ∈
        
          n
        
        ,
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        ∈
        c
        
          
            }
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi (e)=\inf {\biggl \{}\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }p(a_{i})\,{\bigg |}\,e\subseteq \bigcup _{i=0}^{\infty }a_{i},\forall i\in \mathbb {n} ,a_{i}\in c{\biggr \}}.}
  that is, the infimum extends over all sequences {ai}  of elements of c which cover e, with the convention that the infimum is infinite if no such sequence exists.  then φ is an outer measure on x.


=== method ii ===
the second technique is more suitable for constructing outer measures on metric spaces, since it yields metric outer measures. suppose (x, d) is a metric space. as above c is a family of subsets of x which contains the empty set and p a non-negative extended real valued function on c which vanishes on the empty set.  for each δ > 0, let

  
    
      
        
          c
          
            δ
          
        
        =
        {
        a
        ∈
        c
        :
        diam
        ⁡
        (
        a
        )
        ≤
        δ
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{\delta }=\{a\in c:\operatorname {diam} (a)\leq \delta \}}
  and

  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            δ
          
        
        (
        e
        )
        =
        inf
        
          
            {
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        p
        (
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        )
        
        
          
            |
          
        
        
        e
        ⊆
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        ∀
        i
        ∈
        
          n
        
        ,
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        ∈
        
          c
          
            δ
          
        
        
          
            }
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{\delta }(e)=\inf {\biggl \{}\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }p(a_{i})\,{\bigg |}\,e\subseteq \bigcup _{i=0}^{\infty }a_{i},\forall i\in \mathbb {n} ,a_{i}\in c_{\delta }{\biggr \}}.}
  obviously, φδ ≥ φδ' when δ ≤ δ' since the infimum is taken over a smaller class as δ decreases. thus

  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            δ
            →
            0
          
        
        
          φ
          
            δ
          
        
        (
        e
        )
        =
        
          φ
          
            0
          
        
        (
        e
        )
        ∈
        [
        0
        ,
        ∞
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{\delta \rightarrow 0}\varphi _{\delta }(e)=\varphi _{0}(e)\in [0,\infty ]}
  exists (possibly infinite).
theorem. φ0 is a metric outer measure on x.
this is the construction used in the definition of hausdorff measures for a metric space.
