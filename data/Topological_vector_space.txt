in mathematics, a topological vector space (also called a linear topological space and commonly abbreviated tvs or t.v.s.) is one of the basic structures investigated in functional analysis. 
a topological vector space is a vector space (an algebraic structure) which is also a topological space, this implies that vector space operations are continuous functions. 
more specifically, its topological space has a uniform topological structure, allowing a notion of uniform convergence.
the elements of topological vector spaces are typically functions or linear operators acting on topological vector spaces, and the topology is often defined so as to capture a particular notion of convergence of sequences of functions.
banach spaces, hilbert spaces and sobolev spaces are well-known examples.
unless stated otherwise, the underlying field of a topological vector space is assumed to be either the complex numbers 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} }
   or the real numbers 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} .}
  


== motivation ==
normed spaces
every normed vector space has a natural topological structure: the norm induces a metric and the metric induces a topology. 
this is a topological vector space because:

the vector addition 
  
    
      
        ⋅
        
        +
        
        ⋅
        
        :
        x
        ×
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cdot \,+\,\cdot \;:x\times x\to x}
   is jointly continuous with respect to this topology. this follows directly from the triangle inequality obeyed by the norm.
the scalar multiplication 
  
    
      
        ⋅
        :
        
          k
        
        ×
        x
        →
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cdot :\mathbb {k} \times x\to x,}
   where 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
   is the underlying scalar field of 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   is jointly continuous. this follows from the triangle inequality and homogeneity of the norm.thus all banach spaces and hilbert spaces are examples of topological vector spaces.
non-normed spaces
there are topological vector spaces whose topology is not induced by a norm, but are still of interest in analysis. 
examples of such spaces are spaces of holomorphic functions on an open domain, spaces of infinitely differentiable functions, the schwartz spaces, and spaces of test functions and the spaces of distributions on them. 
these are all examples of montel spaces. 
an infinite-dimensional montel space is never normable. 
the existence of a norm for a given topological vector space is characterized by kolmogorov's normability criterion.
a topological field is a topological vector space over each of its subfields.


== definition ==

a topological vector space (tvs) 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a vector space over a topological field 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
   (most often the real or complex numbers with their standard topologies) that is endowed with a topology such that vector addition 
  
    
      
        ⋅
        
        +
        
        ⋅
        
        :
        x
        ×
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cdot \,+\,\cdot \;:x\times x\to x}
   and scalar multiplication 
  
    
      
        ⋅
        :
        
          k
        
        ×
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cdot :\mathbb {k} \times x\to x}
   are continuous functions (where the domains of these functions are endowed with product topologies). such a topology is called a vector topology or a tvs topology on 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
  
every topological vector space is also a commutative topological group under addition.
hausdorff assumption
some authors (for example, walter rudin) require the topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to be t1; it then follows that the space is hausdorff, and even tychonoff. 
a topological vector space is said to be separated if it is hausdorff; importantly, "separated" does not mean separable. 
the topological and linear algebraic structures can be tied together even more closely with additional assumptions, the most common of which are listed below.
category and morphisms
the category of topological vector spaces over a given topological field 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
   is commonly denoted tvs
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
   or tvect
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
  . 
the objects are the topological vector spaces over 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
   and the morphisms are the continuous 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
  -linear maps from one object to another.
a topological vector space homomorphism (abbreviated tvs homomorphism) or topological homomorphism is a continuous linear map 
  
    
      
        u
        :
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle u:x\to y}
   between topological vector spaces (tvss) such that the induced map 
  
    
      
        u
        :
        x
        →
        im
        ⁡
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u:x\to \operatorname {im} u}
   is an open mapping when 
  
    
      
        im
        ⁡
        u
        :=
        u
        (
        x
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {im} u:=u(x),}
   which is the range or image of 
  
    
      
        u
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle u,}
   is given the subspace topology induced by y.
a topological vector space embedding (abbreviated tvs embedding) or a topological monomorphism is an injective topological homomorphism. equivalently, a tvs-embedding is a linear map that is also a topological embedding.a topological vector space isomorphism (abbreviated tvs isomorphism), also called a topological vector isomorphism  or an isomorphism in the category of tvss, is a bijective linear homeomorphism. equivalently, it is a surjective tvs embeddingmany properties of tvss that are studied, such as local convexity, metrizability, completeness, and normability, are invariant under tvs isomorphisms.
a necessary condition for a vector topology
a collection 
  
    
      
        
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {n}}}
   of subsets of a vector space is called additive if for every 
  
    
      
        n
        ∈
        
          
            n
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\in {\mathcal {n}},}
   there exists some 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in {\mathcal {n}}}
   such that 
  
    
      
        u
        +
        u
        ⊆
        n
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle u+u\subseteq n.}
  

all of the above conditions are consequently a necessity for a topology to form a vector topology.


=== defining topologies using neighborhoods of the origin ===
since every vector topology is translation invariant (which means that for all 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ∈
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}\in x,}
   the map 
  
    
      
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\to x}
   defined by 
  
    
      
        x
        ↦
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        +
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\mapsto x_{0}+x}
   is a homeomorphism), to define a vector topology it suffices to define a neighborhood basis (or subbasis) for it at the origin.

in general, the set of all balanced and absorbing subsets of a vector space does not satisfy the conditions of this theorem and does not form a neighborhood basis at the origin for any vector topology.

moreover, if a vector space

   has countable dimension then every string contains an absolutely convex string.
summative sequences of sets have the particularly nice property that they define non-negative continuous real-valued subadditive functions. 
these functions can then be used to prove many of the basic properties of topological vector spaces.

a proof of the above theorem is given in the article on metrizable tvss.

defining vector topologies using collections of strings is particularly useful for defining classes of tvss that are not necessarily locally convex.

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {s} }
   is the set of all topological strings in a tvs

        ,
        τ

   then

a hausdorff tvs is metrizable if and only if its topology can be induced by a single topological string.


== topological structure ==
a vector space is an abelian group with respect to the operation of addition, and in a topological vector space the inverse operation is always continuous (since it is the same as multiplication by −1). 
hence, every topological vector space is an abelian topological group. 
every tvs is completely regular but a tvs need not be normal.let 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   be a topological vector space. given a subspace 
  
    
      
        m
        ⊆
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\subseteq x,}
   the quotient space 
  
    
      
        x
        
          /
        
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle x/m}
   with the usual quotient topology is a hausdorff topological vector space if and only if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is closed. 
this permits the following construction: given a topological vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (that is probably not hausdorff), form the quotient space 
  
    
      
        x
        
          /
        
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle x/m}
   where 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is the closure of 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0\}.}
   

  
    
      
        x
        
          /
        
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle x/m}
   is then a hausdorff topological vector space that can be studied instead of 
  
    
      
        x

=== invariance of vector topologies ===
one of the most used properties of vector topologies is that every vector topology is translation invariant:

for all 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ∈
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}\in x,}
   the map 
  
    
      
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\to x}
   defined by 
  
    
      
        x
        ↦
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        +
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\mapsto x_{0}+x}
   is a homeomorphism, but if 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}\neq 0}
   then it is not linear and so not a tvs-isomorphism.scalar multiplication by a non-zero scalar is a tvs-isomorphism. this means that if 
  
    
      
        s
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\neq 0}
   then the linear map 
  
    
      
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\to x}

        ↦
        s
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\mapsto sx}
   is a homeomorphism.

        s
        =
        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=-1}
   produces the negation map 
  
    
      
        x
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\to x}
   defined by 
  
    
      
        x
        ↦
        −
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\mapsto -x,}
   which is consequently a linear homeomorphism and thus a tvs-isomorphism.

  every neighborhood of 0 is an absorbing set and contains an open balanced neighborhood of 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
   so every topological vector space has a local base of absorbing and balanced sets. 
the origin even has a neighborhood basis consisting of closed balanced neighborhoods of 0; if the space is locally convex then it also has a neighborhood basis consisting of closed convex balanced neighborhoods of 0.
bounded subsets
a subset 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   of a topological vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is bounded if for every neighborhood 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   of the origin, then 
  
    
      
        e
        ⊆
        t
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle e\subseteq tv}
   when 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is sufficiently large.
the definition of boundedness can be weakened a bit; 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is bounded if and only if every countable subset of it is bounded. a set is bounded if and only if each of its subsequences is a bounded set.
also, 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is bounded if and only if for every balanced neighborhood 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   of 0, there exists 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   such that 
  
    
      
        e
        ⊆
        t
        v
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle e\subseteq tv.}
   
moreover, when 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is locally convex, the boundedness can be characterized by seminorms: the subset 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is bounded if and only if every continuous seminorm 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is bounded on 
  
    
      
        e
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle e.}
  
every totally bounded set is bounded. 
if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a vector subspace of a tvs 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   then a subset of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is bounded in 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   if and only if it is bounded in 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
  


=== metrizability ===

a tvs is pseudometrizable if and only if it has a countable neighborhood basis at the origin, or equivalent, if and only if its topology is generated by an f-seminorm. a tvs is metrizable if and only if it is hausdorff and pseudometrizable.
more strongly: a topological vector space is said to be normable if its topology can be induced by a norm. 
a topological vector space is normable if and only if it is hausdorff and has a convex bounded neighborhood of 
  
    
      
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0.}
  let 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
   be a non-discrete locally compact topological field, for example the real or complex numbers. 
a hausdorff topological vector space over 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} }
   is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional, that is, isomorphic to 
  
    
      
        
          
            k
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} ^{n}}
   for some natural number 
  
    
      
        n
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle n.}
  


=== completeness and uniform structure ===

the canonical uniformity on a tvs 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        τ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,\tau )}
   is the unique translation-invariant uniformity that induces the topology 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   on 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
  
every tvs is assumed to be endowed with this canonical uniformity, which makes all tvss into uniform spaces. 
this allows one to about related notions such as completeness, uniform convergence, cauchy nets, and uniform continuity. etc., which are always assumed to be with respect to this uniformity (unless indicated other). 
this implies that every hausdorff topological vector space is tychonoff.
a subspace of a tvs is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded (for hausdorff tvss, a set being totally bounded is equivalent to it being precompact). but if the tvs is not hausdorff then there exist compact subsets that are not closed. however, the closure of a compact subset of a non-hausdorff tvs is again compact (so compact subsets are relatively compact).
with respect to this uniformity, a net (or sequence) 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                i
              
            
            )
          
          
            i
            ∈
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i\in i}}
   is cauchy if and only if for every neighborhood 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   of 
  
    
      
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0,}
   there exists some index 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        −
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
        ∈
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}-x_{j}\in v}
   whenever 
  
    
      
        i
        ≥
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\geq n}
   and 
  
    
      
        j
        ≥
        n
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle j\geq n.}
  
every cauchy sequence is bounded, although cauchy nets and cauchy filters may not be bounded. 
a topological vector space where every cauchy sequence converges is called sequentially complete; in general, it may not be complete (in the sense that all cauchy filters converge).
the vector space operation of addition is uniformly continuous and an open map. scalar multiplication is cauchy continuous but in general, it is almost never uniformly continuous. 
because of this, every topological vector space can be completed and is thus a dense linear subspace of a complete topological vector space.

every tvs has a completion and every hausdorff tvs has a hausdorff completion. every tvs (even those that are hausdorff and/or complete) has infinitely many non-isomorphic non-hausdorff completions.
a compact subset of a tvs (not necessarily hausdorff) is complete. a complete subset of a hausdorff tvs is closed.
if 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is a complete subset of a tvs then any subset of 
  
    
      
        c

   that is closed in

a cauchy sequence in a hausdorff tvs 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is not necessarily relatively compact (that is, its closure in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is not necessarily compact).
if a cauchy filter in a tvs has an accumulation point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   then it converges to 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
  
if a series

   converges in a tvs

== examples ==


=== finest and coarsest vector topology ===
let 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   be a real or complex vector space.
trivial topology
the trivial topology or indiscrete topology 
  
    
      
        {
        x
        ,
        ∅
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{x,\varnothing \}}
   is always a tvs topology on any vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and it is the coarsest tvs topology possible.  an important consequence of this is that the intersection of any collection of tvs topologies on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   always contains a tvs topology.  any vector space (including those that are infinite dimensional) endowed with the trivial topology is a compact (and thus locally compact) complete pseudometrizable seminormable locally convex topological vector space. it is hausdorff if and only if 
  
    
      
        dim
        ⁡
        x
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {dim} x=0.}
  
finest vector topology
there exists a tvs topology 
  
    
      
        
          τ
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau _{f}}
   on 
  
    
      
        x

    {\displaystyle x,}
   called the finest vector topology on 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   that is finer than every other tvs-topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (that is, any tvs-topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is necessarily a subset of

            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau _{f}}
  ).  every linear map from

    {\displaystyle \left(x,\tau _{f}\right)}
   into another tvs is necessarily continuous.  if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has an uncountable hamel basis then 
  
    
      
        
          τ
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau _{f}}
   is not locally convex and not metrizable.


=== product vector spaces ===
a cartesian product of a family of topological vector spaces, when endowed with the product topology, is a topological vector space.  consider for instance the set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   of all functions 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          r
        
        →
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:\mathbb {r} \to \mathbb {r} }
   where 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   carries its usual euclidean topology. this set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a real vector space (where addition and scalar multiplication are defined pointwise, as usual) that can be identified with (and indeed, is often defined to be) the cartesian product 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            
              r
            
          
        
        ,
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{\mathbb {r} },,}
   which carries the natural product topology.  with this product topology, 
  
    
      
        x
        :=
        
          
            r
          
          
            
              r
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x:=\mathbb {r} ^{\mathbb {r} }}
   becomes a topological vector space whose topology is called the topology of pointwise convergence on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  .  the reason for this name is the following: if 
  
    
      
        
          
            (

                n
              
            
            )
          
          
            n
            =

== types ==
depending on the application additional constraints are usually enforced on the topological structure of the space. 
in fact, several principal results in functional analysis fail to hold in general for topological vector spaces: the closed graph theorem, the open mapping theorem, and the fact that the dual space of the space separates points in the space.
below are some common topological vector spaces, roughly in order of increasing "niceness."

f-spaces are complete topological vector spaces with a translation-invariant metric.  these include

locally convex topological vector spaces: here each point has a local base consisting of convex sets. by a technique known as minkowski functionals it can be shown that a space is locally convex if and only if its topology can be defined by a family of seminorms. local convexity is the minimum requirement for "geometrical" arguments like the hahn–banach theorem. the

            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{p}}
   spaces with 
  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        p
        ≤
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq p\leq \infty }
  , the space 
  
    
      
        b
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle bv}
   of functions of bounded variation, and certain spaces of measures.
reflexive banach spaces: banach spaces naturally isomorphic to their double dual (see below), which ensures that some geometrical arguments can be carried out. an important example which is not reflexive is 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{1}}
  , whose dual is 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{\infty }}
   but is strictly contained in the dual of 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            ∞
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{\infty }.}
  
hilbert spaces: these have an inner product; even though these spaces may be infinite-dimensional, most geometrical reasoning familiar from finite dimensions can be carried out in them. these include 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            2

   spaces, the

            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{2}}
   sobolev spaces 
  
    
      
        
          w
          
            2
            ,
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle w^{2,k}}
  , and hardy spaces.
euclidean spaces: 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {c} ^{n}}
   with the topology induced by the standard inner product. as pointed out in the preceding section, for a given finite 
  
    
      
        n
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle n,}
   there is only one 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -dimensional topological vector space, up to isomorphism. it follows from this that any finite-dimensional subspace of a tvs is closed. a characterization of finite dimensionality is that a hausdorff tvs is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional (therefore isomorphic to some euclidean space).


== dual space ==

every topological vector space has a continuous dual space—the set 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\prime }}
   of all continuous linear functionals, that is, continuous linear maps from the space into the base field 
  
    
      
        
          k
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {k} .}
   
a topology on the dual can be defined to be the coarsest topology such that the dual pairing each point evaluation 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ′
          
        
        →
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\prime }\to \mathbb {k} }
   is continuous. 
this turns the dual into a locally convex topological vector space. 
this topology is called the weak-* topology. 
this may not be the only natural topology on the dual space; for instance, the dual of a normed space has a natural norm defined on it. 
however, it is very important in applications because of its compactness properties (see banach–alaoglu theorem).
caution: whenever 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a non-normable locally convex space, then the pairing map 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ′
          
        
        ×
        x
        →
        
          k
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\prime }\times x\to \mathbb {k} }
   is never continuous, no matter which vector space topology one chooses on 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ′
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{\prime }.}
   
a topological vector space has a non-trivial continuous dual space if and only if it has a proper convex neighborhood of the origin.

=== closed and compact sets ===
compact and totally bounded sets
a subset of a tvs is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded. thus, in a complete topological vector space, a closed and totally bounded subset is compact. 
a subset 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   of a tvs 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is totally bounded if and only if 
  
    
      
        
          cl
          
            x
          
        
        ⁡
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {cl} _{x}s}
   is totally bounded, if and only if its image under the canonical quotient map 

is totally bounded.every relatively compact set is totally bounded and the closure of a totally bounded set is totally bounded. 
the image of a totally bounded set under a uniformly continuous map (such as a continuous linear map for instance) is totally bounded.
if 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is a subset of a tvs 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   such that every sequence in 
  
    
      
        s

   has a cluster point in 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   then 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is totally bounded.if 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}

   containing 
  
    
      
        k
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle k,}
   then there exists a neighborhood 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   of 0 such that

    {\displaystyle k+n\subseteq u.}
  closure and closed set
the closure of any convex (respectively, any balanced, any absorbing) subset of any tvs has this same property. in particular, the closure of any convex, balanced, and absorbing subset is a barrel. 
the closure of a vector subspace of a tvs is a vector subspace. every finite dimensional vector subspace of a hausdorff tvs is closed. 
the sum of a closed vector subspace and a finite-dimensional vector subspace is closed. 
if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a vector subspace of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is a closed neighborhood of the origin in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   such that 
  
    
      
        u
        ∩
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\cap n}
   is closed in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   then 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}

        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   
the sum of a compact set and a closed set is closed. however, the sum of two closed subsets may fail to be closed (see this footnote for examples). 
if 
  
    
      
        s

        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\neq 0,{\text{ or }}s=\varnothing }
   then equality holds: 
  
    
      
        
          cl
          
            x

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {cl} _{x}(as)=a\operatorname {cl} _{x}s.}
   in particular, every non-zero scalar multiple of a closed set is closed.

   are compact) then 

hulls and compactness
in a general tvs, the closed convex hull of a compact set may fail to be compact. 
the balanced hull of a compact (resp. totally bounded) set has that same property. 
the convex hull of a finite union of compact convex sets is again compact and convex.

        z

=== properties preserved by set operators ===
the balanced hull of a compact (respectively, totally bounded, open) set has that same property.
the (minkowski) sum of two compact (respectively, bounded, balanced, convex) sets has that same property. but the sum of two closed sets need not be closed.
the convex hull of a balanced (resp. open) set is balanced (respectively, open). however, the convex hull of a closed set need not be closed. and the convex hull of a bounded set need not be bounded.the following table, the color of each cell indicates whether or not a given property of subsets of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   (indicated by the column name, "convex" for instance) is preserved under the set operator (indicated by the row's name, "closure" for instance). 
if in every tvs, a property is preserved under the indicated set operator then that cell will be colored green; otherwise, it will be colored red.
so for instance, since the union of two absorbing sets is again absorbing, the cell in row "
  
    
      
        r
        ∪
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle r\cup s}
  " and column "absorbing" is colored green. 
but since the arbitrary intersection of absorbing sets need not be absorbing, the cell in row "arbitrary intersections (of at least 1 set)" and column "absorbing" is colored red. 
if a cell is not colored then that information has yet to be filled in.
