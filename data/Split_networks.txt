for a given set of taxa like x, and a set of splits s on x, usually together with a non-negative weighting, which may represent character changes distance, or may also have a more abstract interpretation, if the set of splits s is compatible, then it can be represented by an unrooted phylogenetic tree and each edge in the tree corresponds to exactly one of the splits. more generally, s can always be represented by a split network, which is an unrooted phylogenetic network with the property that every split s in s is represented by an array of parallel edges in the network.
a split network n can be obtained from a number of different types of data:

split networks from distances
split networks from trees
split networks from sequences
split networks from quartets
