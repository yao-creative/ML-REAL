in mathematics, transform theory is the study of transforms, which relate a function in one domain to another function in a second domain. the essence of transform theory is that by a suitable choice of basis for a vector space a problem may be simplified—or diagonalized as in spectral theory.


== spectral theory ==
in spectral theory, the spectral theorem says that if a is an n×n self-adjoint matrix, there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of a. this implies that a is diagonalizable.
furthermore, each eigenvalue is real.
