in physics, and more specifically in hamiltonian mechanics, a generating function is, loosely, a function whose partial derivatives generate the differential equations that determine a system's dynamics. common examples are the partition function of statistical mechanics, the hamiltonian, and the function which acts as a bridge between two sets of canonical variables when performing a canonical transformation.


== in canonical transformations ==
there are four basic generating functions, summarized by the following table:

sometimes a given hamiltonian can be turned into one that looks like the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian, which is

  
    
      
        h
        =
        a
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
        +
        b
        
          q
          
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h=ap^{2}+bq^{2}.}
  for example, with the hamiltonian

  
    
      
        h
        =
        
          
            1
            
              2
              
                q
                
                  2
                
              
            
          
        
        +
        
          
            
              
                p
                
                  2
                
              
              
                q
                
                  4
                
              
            
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle h={\frac {1}{2q^{2}}}+{\frac {p^{2}q^{4}}{2}},}
  where p is the generalized momentum and q is the generalized coordinate, a good canonical transformation to choose would be

this turns the hamiltonian into

  
    
      
        h
        =
        
          
            
              q
              
                2
              
            
            2
          
        
        +
        
          
            
              p
              
                2
              
            
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle h={\frac {q^{2}}{2}}+{\frac {p^{2}}{2}},}
  which is in the form of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian.
the generating function f for this transformation is of the third kind,

  
    
      
        f
        =
        
          f
          
            3
          
        
        (
        p
        ,
        q
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f=f_{3}(p,q).}
  to find f explicitly, use the equation for its derivative from the table above,

  
    
      
        p
        =
        −
        
          
            
              ∂
              
                f
                
                  3
                
              
            
            
              ∂
              q
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle p=-{\frac {\partial f_{3}}{\partial q}},}
  and substitute the expression for p from equation (1), expressed in terms of p and q:

  
    
      
        
          
            p
            
              q
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        =
        −
        
          
            
              ∂
              
                f
                
                  3
                
              
            
            
              ∂
              q
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {p}{q^{2}}}=-{\frac {\partial f_{3}}{\partial q}}}
  integrating this with respect to q results in an equation for the generating function of the transformation given by equation (1):

to confirm that this is the correct generating function, verify that it matches (1):

  
    
      
        q
        =
        −
        
          
            
              ∂
              
                f
                
                  3
                
              
            
            
              ∂
              p
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              −
              1
            
            q
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle q=-{\frac {\partial f_{3}}{\partial p}}={\frac {-1}{q}}}
