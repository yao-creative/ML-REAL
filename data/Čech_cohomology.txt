in mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, čech cohomology is a cohomology theory based on the intersection properties of open covers of a topological space. it is named for the mathematician eduard čech.


== motivation ==
let x be a topological space, and let 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}}
   be an open cover of x. let 
  
    
      
        n
        (
        
          
            u
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle n({\mathcal {u}})}
   denote the nerve of the covering. the idea of čech cohomology is that, for an open cover 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}}
   consisting of sufficiently small open sets, the resulting simplicial complex 
  
    
      
        n
        (
        
          
            u
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle n({\mathcal {u}})}
   should be a good combinatorial model for the space x. for such a cover, the čech cohomology of x is defined to be the simplicial cohomology of the nerve. this idea can be formalized by the notion of a good cover. however, a more general approach is to take the direct limit of the cohomology groups of the nerve over the system of all possible open covers of x, ordered by refinement. this is the approach adopted below.


== construction ==
let x be a topological space, and let 
  
    
      
        
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}}
   be a presheaf of abelian groups on x. let 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}}
   be an open cover of x.


=== simplex ===
a q-simplex σ of 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}}
   is an ordered collection of q+1 sets chosen from 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}}
  , such that the intersection of all these sets is non-empty. this intersection is called the support of σ and is denoted |σ|.
now let 
  
    
      
        σ
        =
        (
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        
          )
          
            i
            ∈
            {
            0
            ,
            …
            ,
            q
            }
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma =(u_{i})_{i\in \{0,\ldots ,q\}}}
   be such a q-simplex. the j-th partial boundary of σ is defined to be the (q−1)-simplex obtained by removing the j-th set from σ, that is: 

  
    
      
        
          ∂
          
            j
          
        
        σ
        :=
        (
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        
          )
          
            i
            ∈
            {
            0
            ,
            …
            ,
            q
            }
            ∖
            {
            j
            }
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \partial _{j}\sigma :=(u_{i})_{i\in \{0,\ldots ,q\}\setminus \{j\}}.}
  the boundary of σ is defined as the alternating sum of the partial boundaries:

  
    
      
        ∂
        σ
        :=
        
          ∑
          
            j
            =
            0
          
          
            q
          
        
        (
        −
        1
        
          )
          
            j
            +
            1
          
        
        
          ∂
          
            j
          
        
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \partial \sigma :=\sum _{j=0}^{q}(-1)^{j+1}\partial _{j}\sigma }
  viewed as an element of the free abelian group spanned by the simplices of 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {u}}}
  .

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {f}}(|\sigma |)}
   and we denote the set of all q-cochains of

the coboundary operator is analogous to the exterior derivative of de rham cohomology, so it sometimes called 
the differential of the cochain complex.

        {
        x
        ∣
        
          ρ

        0
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{x\mid \rho _{i}(x)>0\}}
   is contained in some element of the cover. if x is paracompact and hausdorff, then numerable čech cohomology agrees with the usual čech cohomology.

if x is compact hausdorff, then čech cohomology (with coefficients in a discrete group) is isomorphic to alexander-spanier cohomology.

  from čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology. it is always an isomorphism in degrees n = 0 and 1, but may fail to be so in general. for the zariski topology on a noetherian separated scheme, čech and sheaf cohomology agree for any quasi-coherent sheaf. for the étale topology, the two cohomologies agree for any étale sheaf on x, provided that any finite set of points of x are contained in some open affine subscheme. this is satisfied, for example, if x is quasi-projective over an affine scheme.the possible difference between cech cohomology and sheaf cohomology is a motivation for the use of hypercoverings: these are more general objects than the cech nerve
