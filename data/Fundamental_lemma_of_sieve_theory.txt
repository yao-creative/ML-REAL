in number theory, the fundamental lemma of sieve theory is any of several results that systematize the process of applying sieve methods to particular problems. halberstam & richert
: 92–93 
write:

a curious feature of sieve literature is that while there is frequent use of brun's method there are only a few attempts to formulate a general brun theorem (such as theorem 2.1); as a result there are surprisingly many papers which repeat in considerable detail the steps of brun's argument.

attribute the terminology fundamental lemma to jonas kubilius.


== common notation ==
we use these notations:

a is a set of x positive integers, and ad is its subset of integers divisible by d
w(d) and rd are functions of a and of d that estimate the number of elements of a that are divisible by d, according to the formula
  
    
      
        
          |
          
            a
            
              d
            
          
          |
        
        =
        
          
            
              w
              (
              d
              )
            
            d
          
        
        x
        +
        
          r
          
            d
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\vert a_{d}\right\vert ={\frac {w(d)}{d}}x+r_{d}.}
  
thus w(d) / d represents an approximate density of members divisible by d, and rd represents an error or remainder term.p is a set of primes, and p(z) is the product of those primes ≤ z
s(a, p, z) is the number of elements of a not divisible by any prime in p that is ≤ z
κ is a constant, called the sifting density,: 28  that appears in the assumptions below. it is a weighted average of the number of residue classes sieved out by each prime.

  in applications we pick u to get the best error term. in the sieve it represents the number of levels of the inclusion–exclusion principle.

  note that u is no longer an independent parameter at our disposal, but is controlled by the choice of z.
note that the error term here is weaker than for the fundamental lemma of the combinatorial sieve. halberstam & richert remark:: 221  "thus it is not true to say, as has been asserted from time to time in the literature, that selberg's sieve is always better than brun's."
