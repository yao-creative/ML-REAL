in the field of number theory, the brun sieve (also called brun's pure sieve) is a technique for estimating the size of "sifted sets" of positive integers which satisfy a set of conditions which are expressed by congruences.  it was developed by viggo brun in 1915.


== description ==
in terms of sieve theory the brun sieve is of combinatorial type; that is, it derives from a careful use of the inclusion–exclusion principle.
let a be a finite set of positive integers. 
let p be some set of primes.  
for each p in p, let ap denote the set of elements of a which are divisible by p. 
we extend this by setting ad to be the intersection of the ap for p dividing d, where in turn d is a product of distinct primes, all of which are chosen from p.  
finally, define a1 to be a itself.  
let z be a positive real number. 
the object of the sieve is to estimate:

  
    
      
        s
        (
        a
        ,
        p
        ,
        z
        )
        =
        
          |
          
            a
            ∖
            
              ⋃
              
                
                  
                    
                      p
                      ∈
                      p
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      p
                      ≤
                      z
                    
                  
                
              
            
            
              a
              
                p
              
            
          
          |
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(a,p,z)=\left\vert a\setminus \bigcup _{\begin{array}{c}p\in p\\p\leq z\end{array}}a_{p}\right\vert ,}
  where the notation |x| denotes the cardinality of a set x, which in this case is just the number of elements. 
we assume that |ad | may be estimated by

== applications ==
brun's theorem: the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes converges;
schnirelmann's theorem: every even number is a sum of at most c primes (where c can be taken to be 6);
there are infinitely many pairs of integers differing by 2, where each of the member of the pair is the product of at most 9 primes;
every even number is the sum of two numbers each of which is the product of at most 9 primes.the last two results were superseded by chen's theorem, and the second by goldbach's weak conjecture (c = 3).
