in algebraic topology, a k-chain
is a formal linear combination of the k-cells in a cell complex. in simplicial complexes (respectively, cubical complexes), k-chains are combinations of k-simplices (respectively, k-cubes), but not necessarily connected. chains are used in homology; the elements of a homology group are equivalence classes of chains.

== integration on chains ==
integration is defined on chains by taking the linear combination of integrals over the simplices in the chain with coefficients (which are typically integers).
the set of all k-chains forms a group and the sequence of these groups is called a chain complex.


== boundary operator on chains ==

the boundary of a chain is the linear combination of boundaries of the simplices in the chain.  the boundary of a k-chain is a (k−1)-chain. note that the boundary of a simplex is not a simplex, but a chain with coefficients 1 or −1 – thus chains are the closure of simplices under the boundary operator.
example 1: the boundary of a path is the formal difference of its endpoints: it is a telescoping sum. to illustrate, if the 1-chain

example 2: the boundary of the triangle is a formal sum of its edges with signs arranged to make the traversal of the boundary counterclockwise.
a chain is called a cycle when its boundary is zero.  a chain that is the boundary of another chain is called a boundary.  boundaries are cycles,
so chains form a chain complex, whose homology groups (cycles modulo boundaries) are called simplicial homology groups.
example 3: the plane punctured at the origin has nontrivial 1-homology group since the unit circle is a cycle, but not a boundary.
in differential geometry, the duality between the boundary operator on chains and the exterior derivative is expressed by the general stokes' theorem.
