creation operators and annihilation operators are   mathematical operators that  have widespread applications in quantum mechanics, notably in the study of quantum harmonic oscillators and many-particle systems. an annihilation operator (usually denoted

  ) increases the number of particles in a given state by one, and it is the adjoint of the annihilation operator. in many subfields of physics and chemistry, the use of these operators instead of wavefunctions is known as second quantization. they were introduced by paul dirac.creation and annihilation operators can act on states of various types of particles. for example, in quantum chemistry and many-body theory the creation and annihilation operators often act on electron states.  they can also refer specifically to the ladder operators for the quantum harmonic oscillator. in the latter case, the raising operator is interpreted as a creation operator, adding a quantum of energy to the oscillator system (similarly for the lowering operator). they can be used to represent phonons. constructing hamiltonians using these operators has the advantage that the theory automatically satisfies the cluster decomposition theorem.the mathematics for the creation and annihilation operators for bosons is the same as for the  ladder operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator. for example, the commutator of the creation and annihilation operators that are associated with the same boson state equals one, while all other commutators vanish. however, for fermions the mathematics is different, involving anticommutators instead of commutators.


== ladder operators for the quantum harmonic oscillator ==

in the context of the quantum harmonic oscillator, one reinterprets the ladder operators as creation and annihilation operators, adding or subtracting fixed quanta of energy to the oscillator system.
creation/annihilation operators are different for bosons (integer spin) and fermions (half-integer spin). this is because their wavefunctions have different symmetry properties.
first consider the simpler bosonic case of the photons of the quantum harmonic oscillator.

== generalized creation and annihilation operators ==

the operators derived above are actually a specific instance of a more generalized notion of creation and annihilation operators. the more abstract form of the operators are constructed as follows. let 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   be a one-particle hilbert space (that is, any hilbert space, viewed as representing the state of a single particle).
the (bosonic) ccr algebra over 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is the algebra-with-conjugation-operator (called *) abstractly generated by elements 
  
    
      
        a
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a(f)}
  , where 
  
    
      
        f
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\,}
  ranges freely over 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
  , subject to the relations

        (
        f
        )

    {\displaystyle [a(f),a^{\dagger }(g)]=\langle f\mid g\rangle ,}
  in bra–ket notation.
the map 
  
    
      
        a
        :

    {\displaystyle a:f\to a(f)}
   from 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   to the bosonic ccr algebra is required to be complex antilinear (this adds more relations). its adjoint is 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            †
          
        
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{\dagger }(f)}
  , and the map 
  
    
      
        f
        →
        
          a
          
            †
          
        
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\to a^{\dagger }(f)}
   is complex linear in h. thus 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   embeds as a complex vector subspace of its own ccr algebra. in a representation of this algebra, the element 
  
    
      
        a
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a(f)}
   will be realized as an annihilation operator, and  
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            †
          
        
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{\dagger }(f)}
   as a creation operator.
in general, the ccr algebra is infinite dimensional. if we take a banach space completion, it becomes a c*-algebra. the ccr algebra over 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is closely related to, but not identical to, a weyl algebra.
for fermions, the (fermionic) car algebra over 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is constructed similarly, but using anticommutator relations instead, namely

  
    
      
        {
        a
        (
        f
        )

        {
        a
        (
        f
        )

  the car algebra is finite dimensional only if 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is finite dimensional. if we take a banach space completion (only necessary in the infinite dimensional case), it becomes a

== creation and annihilation operators for reaction-diffusion equations ==
the annihilation and creation operator description has also been useful to analyze classical reaction diffusion equations, such as the situation when a gas of molecules 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   diffuse and interact on contact, forming an inert product: 
  
    
      
        a
        +
        a
        →
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle a+a\to \emptyset }
  . to see how this kind of reaction can be described by the annihilation and creation operator formalism, consider 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{i}}
   particles at a site i on a one dimensional lattice. each particle moves to the right or left with a certain probability, and each pair of  particles at the same site annihilates each other with a certain other probability.
the probability that one particle leaves the site during the short time period dt is proportional to 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{i}\,dt}
  , let us say a probability 
  
    
      
        α
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha n_{i}dt}
   to hop left and 
  
    
      
        α
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha n_{i}\,dt}
   to hop right. all 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{i}}
   particles will stay put with a probability 
  
    
      
        1
        −
        2
        α
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
        
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1-2\alpha n_{i}\,dt}
  . (since dt  is so short, the probability that two or more will leave during dt is very small and will be ignored.)
we can now describe the occupation of particles on the lattice as a `ket' of the form

  other kinds of interactions can be included in a similar manner.
this kind of notation allows the use of quantum field theoretic techniques to be used in the analysis of reaction diffusion systems.


== creation and annihilation operators in quantum field theories ==

in quantum field theories and many-body problems one works with creation and annihilation operators of quantum states,

    {\displaystyle a_{i}^{\,}}
  .  these operators change the eigenvalues of the number operator,

  
    
      
        n
        =
        
          ∑

  ,by one, in analogy to the harmonic oscillator.  the indices (such as 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  ) represent quantum numbers that label the single-particle states of the system; hence, they are not necessarily single numbers.  for example, a tuple of quantum numbers 
  
    
      
        (
        n
        ,
        l
        ,

        ,
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (n,l,m,s)}
   is used to label states in the hydrogen atom.

    {\displaystyle i\neq j}
  ) operators in a product of creation or annihilation operators will reverse the sign in fermion systems, but not in boson systems.
if the states labelled by i are an orthonormal basis of a hilbert space h, then the result of this construction coincides with the ccr algebra and car algebra construction in the previous section but one. if they represent "eigenvectors" corresponding to the continuous spectrum of some operator, as for unbound particles in qft, then the interpretation is more subtle.
