in functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a set in a topological vector space is called bounded or von neumann bounded, if every neighborhood of the zero vector can be inflated to include the set. 
a set that is not bounded is called unbounded.
bounded sets are a natural way to define locally convex polar topologies on the vector spaces in a dual pair, as the polar set of a bounded set is an absolutely convex and absorbing set. 
the concept was first introduced by john von neumann and andrey kolmogorov in 1935.

==== examples ====
in any locally convex tvs, the set of closed and bounded disks are a base of bounded set.


== stability properties ==
unless indicated otherwise, a topological vector space (tvs) need not be hausdorff nor locally convex.

in any tvs, finite unions, finite sums, scalar multiples, translations, subsets, closures, interiors, and balanced hulls of bounded sets are again bounded.
in any locally convex tvs, the convex hull of a bounded set is again bounded. this may fail to be true if the space is not locally convex.

== examples and sufficient conditions ==
in any topological vector space (tvs), finite sets are bounded.
every totally bounded subset of a tvs is bounded.
every relatively compact set in a topological vector space is bounded. if the space is equipped with the weak topology the converse is also true.
the set of points of a cauchy sequence is bounded, the set of points of a cauchy net need not be bounded.

== properties ==

finite unions, finite minkowski sums, closures, interiors, and balanced hulls of bounded sets are bounded.
the image of a bounded set under a continuous linear map is bounded.
in a locally convex space, the convex envelope of a bounded set is bounded.
without local convexity this is false, as the lp space

            p

        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0<p<1}
   have no nontrivial open convex subsets.a locally convex topological vector space has a bounded neighborhood of zero if and only if its topology can be defined by a single seminorm.
the polar of a bounded set is an absolutely convex and absorbing set.


== generalization ==
the definition of bounded sets can be generalized to topological modules.

        r

        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}

          0
          
            m
