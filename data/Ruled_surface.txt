in geometry, a surface s is ruled (also called a scroll) if through every point of s there is a straight line that lies on s.  examples include the plane, the lateral surface of a cylinder or cone, a conical surface with elliptical directrix, the right conoid, the helicoid, and the tangent developable of a smooth curve in space.
a ruled surface can be described as the set of points swept by a  moving straight line.  for example, a cone is formed by keeping one point of a line fixed whilst moving another point along a circle. a surface is doubly ruled if through every one of its points there are two distinct lines that lie on the surface.  the hyperbolic paraboloid and the hyperboloid of one sheet are doubly ruled surfaces. the plane is the only surface which contains at least three distinct lines through each of its points (fuchs & tabachnikov 2007).
the properties of being ruled or doubly ruled are preserved by projective maps, and therefore are concepts of projective geometry. in algebraic geometry ruled surfaces are sometimes considered to be surfaces in affine or projective space over a field, but they are also sometimes considered as abstract algebraic surfaces without an embedding into affine or projective space, in which case "straight line" is understood to mean an affine or projective line.


== definition and parametric representation ==

a two dimensional differentiable manifold is called a ruled surface if it is the union of one parametric family of lines. the lines of this family are the generators of the ruled surface.
a ruled surface can be described by a parametric representation of the form 

(cr)

        )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;u\mapsto \mathbf {c} (u)\;}
   is the directrix of the representation. the vectors 
  
    
      
        
        
          r
        
        (
        u
        )
        ≠
        
          
            0
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\mathbf {r} (u)\neq {\bf {0\;}}}
   describe the directions of the generators.
the directrix may collapse to a point (in case of a cone, see example below).
alternatively the ruled surface (cr) can be described by

(cd) 
  
    
      
        
        
          x
        
        (
        u
        ,
        v
        )
        =
        (
        1
        −
        v
        )
        
        
          
            
              c
            
            (
            u
            )
          
        
        +
        v
        
        
          
            
              d
            
            (
            u
            )
          
        
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \quad \mathbf {x} (u,v)=(1-v)\;{\color {red}\mathbf {c} (u)}+v\;{\color {green}\mathbf {d} (u)}\ }
  with the second directrix 
  
    
      
        
        
          d
        
        (
        u
        )
        =
        
          c
        
        (
        u
        )
        +
        
          r
        
        (
        u
        )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\mathbf {d} (u)=\mathbf {c} (u)+\mathbf {r} (u)\;}
  .
alternatively, one can start with two non intersecting curves 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
        (
        u
        )
        ,
        
          d
        
        (
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (u),\mathbf {d} (u)}
   as directrices, and get by (cd) a ruled surface with line directions 
  
    
      
        
        
          r
        
        (
        u
        )
        =
        
          d
        
        (
        u
        )
        −
        
          c
        
        (
        u
        )
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\mathbf {r} (u)=\mathbf {d} (u)-\mathbf {c} (u)\ .}
  
for the generation of a ruled surface by two directrices (or one directrix and the vectors of line directions) not only the geometric shape of these curves are essential but also the special parametric representations of them influence the shape of the ruled surface (see examples a), d)).
for theoretical investigations representation (cr) is more advantageous, because the parameter 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   appears only once.

in this case one could have used the apex as the directrix, i.e.: 
  
    
      
         
        
          c
        
        (

        =

        0
        ,
        0
        
          )

    {\displaystyle \ \mathbf {c} (u)=(0,0,0)^{t}\ }
   and 
  
    
      
         
        
          r
        
        (
        u
        )
        =
        (
        cos
        ⁡
        u
        ,
        sin

        u

            t
          
        
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \mathbf {r} (u)=(\cos u,\sin u,1)^{t}\ }
   as the line directions.
for any cone one can choose the apex as the directrix. this case shows: the directrix of a ruled surface may degenerate to a point.

at any point is true.the generators of any ruled surface coalesce with one family of its asymptotic lines. for developable surfaces they also form one family of its lines of curvature. it can be shown that any developable surface is a cone, a cylinder or a surface formed by all tangents of a space curve.


== application and history of developable surfaces ==

the determinant condition for developable surfaces is used to determine numerically developable connections between space curves (directrices). the diagram shows a developable connection between two ellipses contained in different planes (one horizontal, the other vertical) and its development.an impression of the usage of developable surfaces in computer aided design (cad) is given in  interactive design of developable surfacesa historical survey on developable surfaces can be found in developable surfaces: their history and application


== ruled surfaces in algebraic geometry ==

in algebraic geometry, ruled surfaces were originally defined as projective surfaces in projective space containing a straight line through any given point. this immediately implies that there is a projective line on the surface through any given point, and this condition is now often used as the definition of a ruled surface: ruled surfaces are  defined to be abstract projective surfaces satisfying this condition that there is a projective line through any point. this is equivalent to saying that they are birational to the product of a curve and a projective line. sometimes a ruled surface is defined to be one satisfying the  stronger condition that it has a fibration over a curve with fibers that are projective lines. this excludes the projective plane, which has a projective line though every point but cannot be written as such a fibration.
ruled surfaces appear in the enriques classification of projective complex surfaces, because every algebraic surface of kodaira dimension

   is a ruled surface (or a projective plane, if one uses the restrictive definition of ruled surface). 
every minimal projective ruled surface other than the projective plane is the projective bundle of a 2-dimensional vector bundle over some curve. the ruled surfaces with base curve of genus 0 are the hirzebruch surfaces.


== ruled surfaces in architecture ==
doubly ruled surfaces are the inspiration for curved hyperboloid structures that can be built with a latticework of straight elements, namely:

hyperbolic paraboloids, such as saddle roofs.
hyperboloids of one sheet, such as cooling towers and some trash bins.the rm-81 agena rocket engine employed straight cooling channels that were laid out in a ruled surface to form the throat of the nozzle section.
