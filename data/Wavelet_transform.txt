== principle ==
the fundamental idea of wavelet transforms is that the transformation should allow only changes in time extension, but not shape.  this is affected by choosing suitable basis functions that allow for this. changes in the time extension are expected to conform to the corresponding analysis frequency of the basis function. based on the uncertainty principle of signal processing,

  where 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   represents time and

        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x(t)}
   has been filtered. the transformed signal provides information about the time and the frequency. therefore, wavelet-transformation contains information similar to the short-time-fourier-transformation, but with additional special properties of the wavelets, which show up at the resolution in time at higher analysis frequencies of the basis function. the difference in time resolution at ascending frequencies for the fourier transform and the wavelet transform is shown below. note however, that the frequency resolution is decreasing for increasing frequencies while the temporal resolution increases. this consequence of the fourier uncertainty principle is not correctly displayed in the figure.

this shows that wavelet transformation is good in time resolution of high frequencies, while for slowly varying functions, the frequency resolution is remarkable.

== wavelet compression ==

wavelet compression is a form of data compression well suited for image compression (sometimes also video compression and audio compression). notable implementations are jpeg 2000, djvu and ecw for still images, jpeg xs, cineform, and the bbc's dirac. the goal is to store image data in as little space as possible in a file.  wavelet compression can be either lossless or lossy.using a wavelet transform, the wavelet compression methods are adequate for representing transients, such as percussion sounds in audio, or high-frequency components in two-dimensional images, for example an image of stars on a night sky. this means that the transient elements of a data signal can be represented by a smaller amount of information than would be the case if some other transform, such as the more widespread discrete cosine transform, had been used.
discrete wavelet transform has been successfully applied for the compression of electrocardiograph (ecg) signals in this work, the high correlation between the corresponding wavelet coefficients of signals of successive cardiac cycles is utilized employing linear prediction.
wavelet compression is not effective for all kinds of data. wavelet compression handles transient signals well. but smooth, periodic signals are better compressed using other methods, particularly traditional harmonic analysis in the frequency domain with fourier-related transforms. compressing data that has both transient and periodic characteristics may be done with hybrid techniques that use wavelets along with traditional harmonic analysis. for example, the vorbis audio codec primarily uses the modified discrete cosine transform to compress audio (which is generally smooth and periodic), however allows the addition of a hybrid wavelet filter bank for improved reproduction of transients.see diary of an x264 developer: the problems with wavelets (2010) for discussion of practical issues of current methods using wavelets for video compression.


=== method ===
first a wavelet transform is applied.  this produces as many coefficients as there are pixels in the image (i.e., there is no compression yet since it is only a transform).  these coefficients can then be compressed more easily because the information is statistically concentrated in just a few coefficients.  this principle is called transform coding.  after that, the coefficients are quantized and the quantized values are entropy encoded and/or run length encoded.
a few 1d and 2d applications of wavelet compression use a technique called "wavelet footprints".


=== evaluation ===


==== requirement for image compression ====
for most natural images, the spectrum density of lower frequency is higher. as a result, information of the low frequency signal (reference signal) is generally preserved, while the information in the detail signal is discarded. from the perspective of image compression and reconstruction, a wavelet should meet the following criteria while performing image compression:

being able to transform more original image into the reference signal.
highest fidelity reconstruction based on the reference signal.
should not lead to artifacts in the image reconstructed from the reference signal alone.


==== requirement for shift variance and ringing behavior ====
wavelet image compression system involves filters and decimation, so it can be described as a linear shift-variant system. a typical wavelet transformation diagram is displayed below:

the transformation system contains two analysis filters (a low pass filter 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            0
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{0}(n)}
   and a high pass filter 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            1
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{1}(n)}
  ), a decimation process, an interpolation process, and two synthesis filters (
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            0
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{0}(n)}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{1}(n)}
  ). the compression and reconstruction system generally involves low frequency components, which is the analysis filters 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            0
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{0}(n)}
   for image compression and the synthesis filters 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            0
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{0}(n)}
   for reconstruction. to evaluate such system, we can input an impulse 
  
    
      
        δ
        (
        n
        −
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta (n-n_{i})}
   and observe its reconstruction 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        n
        −
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(n-n_{i})}
  ; the optimal wavelet are those who bring minimum shift variance and sidelobe to 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        n
        −
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(n-n_{i})}
  . even though wavelet with strict shift variance is not realistic, it is possible to select wavelet with only slight shift variance. for example, we can compare the shift variance of two filters:
by observing the impulse responses of the two filters, we can conclude that the second filter is less sensitive to the input location (i.e. it is less shift variant).
another important issue for image compression and reconstruction is the system's oscillatory behavior, which might lead to severe undesired artifacts in the reconstructed image. to achieve this, the wavelet filters should have a large peak to sidelobe ratio.
so far we have discussed about one-dimension transformation of the image compression system. this issue can be extended to two dimension, while a more general term - shiftable multiscale transforms - is proposed.


==== derivation of impulse response ====
as mentioned earlier, impulse response can be used to evaluate the image compression/reconstruction system.

== comparison with fourier transform and time-frequency analysis ==
wavelets have some slight benefits over fourier transforms in reducing computations when examining specific frequencies. however, they are rarely more sensitive, and indeed, the common morlet wavelet is mathematically identical to a short-time fourier transform using a gaussian window function. the exception is when searching for signals of a known, non-sinusoidal shape (e.g., heartbeats); in that case, using matched wavelets can outperform standard stft/morlet analyses.


== other practical applications ==
the wavelet transform can provide us with the frequency of the signals and the time associated to those frequencies, making it very convenient for its application in numerous fields. for instance, signal processing of accelerations for gait analysis, for fault detection, for design of low power pacemakers and also in ultra-wideband (uwb) wireless communications.


== synchro-squeezed transform ==
synchro-squeezed transform can significantly enhance temporal and frequency resolution of time-frequency representation obtained using conventional wavelet transform.
