in mathematics and classical mechanics, the poisson bracket is an important binary operation in hamiltonian mechanics, playing a central role in hamilton's equations of motion, which govern the time evolution of a hamiltonian dynamical system. the poisson bracket also distinguishes a certain class of coordinate transformations, called canonical transformations, which map canonical coordinate systems into canonical coordinate systems. a "canonical coordinate system" consists of canonical position and momentum variables (below symbolized by 
  
    
      
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle q_{i}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{i}}
  , respectively) that satisfy canonical poisson bracket relations. the set of possible canonical transformations is always very rich. for instance, it is often possible to choose the hamiltonian itself 
  
    
      
        h
        =
        h
        (
        q
        ,
        p
        ;
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h=h(q,p;t)}
   as one of the new canonical momentum coordinates.
in a more general sense, the poisson bracket is used to define a poisson algebra, of which the algebra of functions on a poisson manifold is a special case. there are other general examples, as well: it occurs in the theory of lie algebras, where the tensor algebra of a lie algebra forms a poisson algebra; a detailed construction of how this comes about is given in the universal enveloping algebra article. quantum deformations of the universal enveloping algebra lead to the notion of quantum groups.
all of these objects are named in honor of siméon denis poisson.

== constants of motion ==
an integrable dynamical system will have constants of motion in addition to the energy. such constants of motion will commute with the hamiltonian under the poisson bracket. suppose some function 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        p
        ,
        q
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(p,q)}
   is a constant of motion. this implies that if 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        t
        )
        ,
        q
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(t),q(t)}
   is a trajectory or solution to hamilton's equations of motion, then

  
    
      
        0
        =
        
          
            
              d
              f
            
            
              d
              t
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0={\frac {df}{dt}}}
  along that trajectory. then

  
    
      
        0
        =
        
          
            d
            
              d
              t
            
          
        
        f
        (
        p

        q
        )
        =

              t
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0={\frac {d}{dt}}f(p,q)=\{f,h\}+{\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}}
  where, as above, the intermediate step follows by applying the equations of motion and we supposed that 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   does not explicitly depend on time. this equation is known as the liouville equation. the content of liouville's theorem is that the time evolution of a measure (or "distribution function" on the phase space) is given by the above.
if the poisson bracket of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   vanishes (
  
    
      
        {
        f
        ,
        g
        }
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{f,g\}=0}
  ), then 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   are said to be in involution.  in order for a hamiltonian system to be completely integrable, 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   independent constants of motion must be in mutual involution, where 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is the number of degrees of freedom.
furthermore, according to poisson's theorem, if two quantities 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   are explicitly time independent (
  
    
      
        a
        (
        p
        ,
        q
        )
        ,
        b
        (
        p
        ,
        q
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a(p,q),b(p,q)}
  ) constants of motion, so is their poisson bracket 
  
    
      
        {
        a
        ,
        
        b
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{a,\,b\}}
  . this does not always supply a useful result, however, since the number of possible constants of motion is limited (
  
    
      
        2
        n
        −
        1

   for a system with 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   degrees of freedom), and so the result may be trivial (a constant, or a function of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b

it also follows from (1) that the poisson bracket is a derivation; that is, it satisfies a non-commutative version of leibniz's product rule:

the poisson bracket is intimately connected to the lie bracket of the hamiltonian vector fields.  because the lie derivative is a derivation,

thus, the poisson bracket on functions corresponds to the lie bracket of the associated hamiltonian vector fields.  we have also shown that the lie bracket of two symplectic vector fields is a hamiltonian vector field and hence is also symplectic.  in the language of abstract algebra, the symplectic vector fields form a subalgebra of the lie algebra of smooth vector fields on m, and the hamiltonian vector fields form an ideal of this subalgebra.  the symplectic vector fields are the lie algebra of the (infinite-dimensional) lie group of symplectomorphisms of m.
it is widely asserted that the jacobi identity for the poisson bracket,

  
    
      
         
        {
        f
        ,

        }
        +
        {
        g
        ,
        {
        h
        ,
        f
        }
        }
        +
        {
        h
        ,
        {

        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \{f,\{g,h\}\}+\{g,\{h,f\}\}+\{h,\{f,g\}\}=0}
  follows from the corresponding identity for the lie bracket of vector fields, but this is true only up to a locally constant function.  however, to prove the jacobi identity for the poisson bracket, it is sufficient to show that:

  
    
      
        
          ad
          
            {
            f
            ,

        =

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ad} _{\{f,g\}}=[\operatorname {ad} _{f},\operatorname {ad} _{g}]}
  where the operator

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ad} _{g}}
   on smooth functions on m is defined by 
  
    
      
        
          ad
          
            g

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ad} _{g}(\cdot )\;=\;\{\cdot ,\,g\}}
   and the bracket on the right-hand side is the commutator of operators, 
  
    
      
        [
        a
        ,

    {\displaystyle [\operatorname {a} ,\,\operatorname {b} ]\;=\;\operatorname {a} \operatorname {b} -\operatorname {b} \operatorname {a} }
  .  by (1), the operator 
  
    
      
        
          ad
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {ad} _{g}}
   is equal to the operator xg.  the proof of the jacobi identity follows from (3) because the lie bracket of vector fields is just their commutator as differential operators.
the algebra of smooth functions on m, together with the poisson bracket forms a poisson algebra, because it is a lie algebra under the poisson bracket, which additionally satisfies leibniz's rule (2).  we have shown that every symplectic manifold is a poisson manifold, that is a manifold with a "curly-bracket" operator on smooth functions such that the smooth functions form a poisson algebra.  however, not every poisson manifold arises in this way, because poisson manifolds allow for degeneracy which cannot arise in the symplectic case.

== quantization ==
poisson brackets deform to moyal brackets upon quantization, that is, they generalize to a different lie algebra, the moyal algebra, or, equivalently in hilbert space, quantum commutators. the wigner-i̇nönü group contraction of these (the classical limit, ħ → 0)  yields the above lie algebra.
to state this more explicitly and precisely, the universal enveloping algebra of the heisenberg algebra is the weyl algebra (modulo the relation that the center be the unit). the moyal product is then a special case of the star product on the algebra of symbols. an explicit definition of the algebra of symbols, and the star product is given in the article on the universal enveloping algebra.
