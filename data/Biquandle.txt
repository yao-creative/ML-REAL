in mathematics, biquandles and biracks are sets with binary operations that generalize quandles and racks. biquandles take, in the theory of virtual knots, the place that quandles occupy in the theory of classical knots. biracks and racks have the same relation, while a biquandle is a birack which satisfies some additional conditions.


== definitions ==
biquandles and biracks have two binary operations on a set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   written 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{b}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{b}}
  . these satisfy the following three axioms:
1.  
  
    
      
        (
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
        
          )
          
            
              c

        =
        
          
            
              a
              
                c

    {\displaystyle {a_{b}}_{c_{b}}={a_{c}}_{b^{c}}}

              a

    {\displaystyle {a_{b}}^{c_{b}}={a^{c}}_{b^{c}}}
  
these identities appeared in 1992 in reference [frs] where the object was called a species.
the superscript and subscript notation is useful here because it dispenses with the need for brackets. for example,
if we write 
  
    
      
        a
        ∗
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a*b}
   for 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{b}}
   and 
  
    
      
        a
        
          ∗
          ∗
        
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mathbin {**} b}
   for 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{b}}
   then the
three axioms above become
1. 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        
          ∗

        =

        c
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a\mathbin {**} b)\mathbin {**} (c*b)=(a\mathbin {**} c)\mathbin {**} (b\mathbin {**} c)}
  
2. 
  
    
      
        (
        a

        b
        )
        ∗

        =

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a*b)*(c*b)=(a*c)*(b\mathbin {**} c)}
  
3. 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ∗
        b
        )
        
          ∗
          ∗
        
        (
        c
        ∗
        b
        )
        =
        (
        a
        
          ∗
          ∗

        )
        ∗

          ∗
          ∗

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a*b)\mathbin {**} (c*b)=(a\mathbin {**} c)*(b\mathbin {**} c)}
  
if in addition the two operations are invertible, that is given 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,b}
   in the set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   there are unique 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y}
   in the set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
        
        =
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{b}=a}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            b
          
        
        =
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle y_{b}=a}
   then the set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   together with the two operations define a birack.
for example, if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , with the operation 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{b}}
  , is a rack then it is a birack if we define the other operation to be the identity,  
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b
          
        
        =
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{b}=a}
  .
for a birack the function 
  
    
      
        s
        :
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        →
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s:x^{2}\rightarrow x^{2}}
   can be defined by

  
    
      
        s
        (
        a

        .

to see that 1. is true note that

    {\displaystyle s'(b,a^{b})=(a,b_{a})\,}
  is the inverse to

  
    
      
        s
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\,}

a switch will define a birack if the operations are invertible. note that the identity switch does not do this.


== biquandles ==
a biquandle is a birack which satisfies some additional structure, as described by nelson and rische. the axioms of a biquandle are "minimal" in the sense that they are the weakest restrictions that can be placed on the two binary operations while making the biquandle of a virtual knot invariant under reidemeister moves.
