in mathematics, an affine combination of  x1, ..., xn is a linear combination

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =

            n
          
        
        
          
            α
            
              i
            
          
          ⋅
          
            x
            
              i
            
          
        
        =
        
          α
          
            1
          
        
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        +
        
          α

          α

            n
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}{\alpha _{i}\cdot x_{i}}=\alpha _{1}x_{1}+\alpha _{2}x_{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{n}x_{n},}
  such that 

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          
            α
            
              i
            
          
        
        =
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}{\alpha _{i}}=1.}
  here, x1, ..., xn can be elements (vectors) of a vector space over a field k, and the coefficients 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}
   are elements of k.
the elements x1, ..., xn can also be points of a euclidean space, and, more generally, of an affine space over a field k. in this case the 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}
   are elements of k (or 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   for a euclidean space), and the affine combination is also a point. see affine space § affine combinations and barycenter for the definition in this case.
this concept is fundamental in euclidean geometry and affine geometry, as the set of all affine combinations of a set of points form the smallest subspace containing the points, exactly as the linear combinations of a set of vectors form their linear span.
the affine combinations commute with any affine transformation t in the sense that

  
    
      
        t
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          
            α
            
              i
            
          
          ⋅
          
            x
            
              i
            
          
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          
            α
            
              i
            
          
          ⋅
          t
          
            x
            
              i
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle t\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\alpha _{i}\cdot x_{i}}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\alpha _{i}\cdot tx_{i}}.}
  in particular, any affine combination of the fixed points of a given affine transformation 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is also a fixed point of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  , so the set of fixed points of 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   forms an affine subspace (in 3d: a line or a plane, and the trivial cases, a point or the whole space).
when a stochastic matrix, a, acts on a column vector, b→, the result is a column vector whose entries are affine combinations of b→ with coefficients from the rows in a.
