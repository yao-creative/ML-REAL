== history ==
gafa was founded in 1991 by mikhail gromov and vitali milman. the idea for the journal was inspired by the long-running israeli seminar series "geometric aspects of functional analysis" of which vitali milman had been one of the main organizers in the previous years. the journal retained the same acronym as the series to stress the connection between the two.


== journal information ==
the journal is reviewed cover-to-cover in mathematical reviews and zentralblatt math and is indexed cover-to-cover in the web of science. according to the journal citation reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 1.476.the journal has four editors: vitali milman (editor-in-chief), mikhail gromov, simon donaldson and peter sarnak.
