in mathematics, a finite von neumann algebra is a von neumann algebra in which every isometry is a unitary. in other words, for an operator v in a finite von neumann algebra if 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
        v
        =
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle v^{*}v=i}
  , then 
  
    
      
        v
        
          v
          
            ∗
          
        
        =
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle vv^{*}=i}
  . in terms of the comparison theory of projections, the identity operator is not (murray-von neumann) equivalent to any proper subprojection in the von neumann algebra.

=== finite-dimensional von neumann algebras ===
the finite-dimensional von neumann algebras can be characterized using wedderburn's theory of semisimple algebras.
let cn × n be the n × n matrices with complex entries. a von neumann algebra m is a self adjoint subalgebra in cn × n such that m contains the identity operator i in cn × n.
every such m as defined above is a semisimple algebra, i.e. it contains no nilpotent ideals. suppose m ≠ 0 lies in a nilpotent ideal of m. since m* ∈ m by assumption, we have m*m, a positive semidefinite matrix, lies in that nilpotent ideal. this implies (m*m)k =  0 for some k. so m*m = 0, i.e. m = 0.
the center of a von neumann algebra m will be denoted by z(m). since m is self-adjoint, z(m) is itself a (commutative) von neumann algebra. a von neumann algebra n is called a factor if z(n) is one-dimensional, that is, z(n) consists of multiples of the identity i.
theorem every finite-dimensional von neumann algebra m is a direct sum of m factors, where m is the dimension of z(m). 
proof: by wedderburn's theory of semisimple algebras, z(m) contains a finite orthogonal set of idempotents (projections) {pi} such that pipj = 0 for i ≠ j, σ pi = i, and

  
    
      
        z
        (
        
          m
        
        )
        =
        
          ⨁
          
            i
          
        
        z
        (
        
          m
        
        )
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z(\mathbf {m} )=\bigoplus _{i}z(\mathbf {m} )p_{i}}
  where each z(m)pi is a commutative simple algebra. every complex simple algebras is isomorphic to  
the full matrix algebra ck × k for some k. but z(m)pi is commutative, therefore one-dimensional.
the projections pi "diagonalizes" m in a natural way. for m ∈ m, m can be uniquely decomposed into m = σ mpi. therefore,

  
    
      
        
          
            m
          
        
        =
        
          ⨁
          
            i
          
        
        
          
            m
          
        
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathbf {m} }=\bigoplus _{i}{\mathbf {m} }p_{i}.}
  one can see that z(mpi) = z(m)pi. so z(mpi) is one-dimensional and each mpi is a factor. this proves the claim.
for general von neumann algebras, the direct sum is replaced by the direct integral. the above is a special case of the central decomposition of von neumann algebras.
