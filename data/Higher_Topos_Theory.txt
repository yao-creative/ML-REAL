higher topos theory is a mathematical book by american mathematician jacob lurie. the main subject of the book is an ∞-topos. but it also develops the theory of ∞-category as a particular kind of a simplicial set. all together the book provides a categorical foundation for derived algebraic geometry.
the book is available at arxiv:math/0608040, although the copy hosted on lurie's website has been updated more recently. since 2018 lurie has been porting the content of htt over to a stacks project-like web platform, kerodon, and adding new material.
