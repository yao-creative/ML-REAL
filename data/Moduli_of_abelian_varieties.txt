    {\displaystyle h_{g}}
   the structure of a parameter space for all principally polarized abelian varieties. but, there exists an equivalence where

          h
          
            g
          
        
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {a}}_{g}=[\operatorname {sp} _{2g}(\mathbb {z} )\backslash h_{g}]}
  which gives a deligne-mumford stack over 
  
    
      
        spec

  . if this is instead given by a git quotient, then it gives the coarse moduli space 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{g}}

=== principally polarized abelian varieties with level n-structure ===
in many cases, it is easier to work with the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties with level n-structure because it creates a rigidification of the moduli problem which gives a moduli functor instead of a moduli stack. this means the functor is representable by an algebraic manifold, such as a variety or scheme, instead of a stack. a level n-structure is given by a fixed basis of
