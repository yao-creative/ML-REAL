in mathematics, the gaussian or ordinary hypergeometric function 2f1(a,b;c;z) is a special function represented by the hypergeometric series, that includes many other special functions as specific or limiting cases. it is a solution of a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ode). every second-order linear ode with three regular singular points can be transformed into this equation.
for systematic lists of some of the many thousands of published identities involving the hypergeometric function, see the reference works by erdélyi et al. (1953) and olde daalhuis (2010). there is no known system for organizing all of the identities; indeed, there is no known algorithm that can generate all identities; a number of different algorithms are known that generate different series of identities. the theory of the algorithmic discovery of identities remains an active research topic.


== history ==
the term "hypergeometric series" was first used by john wallis in his 1655 book arithmetica infinitorum.
hypergeometric series were studied by leonhard euler, but the first full systematic treatment was given by carl friedrich gauss (1813).
studies in the nineteenth century included those of ernst kummer (1836), and the fundamental characterisation by bernhard riemann (1857) of the hypergeometric function by means of the differential equation it satisfies.
riemann showed that the second-order differential equation for 2f1(z), examined in the complex plane, could be characterised (on the riemann sphere) by its three regular singularities.
the cases where the solutions are algebraic functions were found by hermann schwarz (schwarz's list).

  hence, the name hypergeometric. this function can be considered as a generalization of the geometric series.
the confluent hypergeometric function (or kummer's function) can be given as a limit of the hypergeometric function

  
    
      
        m

        a

        =
        
          lim
          
            b
            →
            ∞

    {\displaystyle m(a,c,z)=\lim _{b\to \infty }{}_{2}f_{1}(a,b;c;b^{-1}z)}
  so all functions that are essentially special cases of it, such as bessel functions, can be expressed as limits of hypergeometric functions. these include most of the commonly used functions of mathematical physics.
legendre functions are solutions of a second order differential equation with 3 regular singular points so can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function in many ways, for example

  which has three regular singular points: 0,1 and ∞. the generalization of this equation to three arbitrary regular singular points is given by riemann's differential equation. any second order differential equation with three regular singular points can be converted to the hypergeometric differential equation by a change of variables.


=== solutions at the singular points ===
solutions to the hypergeometric differential equation are built out of the hypergeometric series 2f1(a,b;c;z). the equation has two linearly independent solutions. at each of the three singular points 0, 1, ∞, there are usually two special solutions of the form xs times a holomorphic function of x, where s is one of the two roots of the indicial equation and x is a local variable vanishing at a regular singular point. this gives 3 × 2 = 6 special solutions, as follows.
around the point z = 0, two independent solutions are, if c is not a non-positive integer,

   the second solution does not exist when c is an integer greater than 1, and is equal to the first solution, or its replacement, when c is any other integer. so when c is an integer, a more complicated expression must be used for a second solution, equal to the first solution multiplied by ln(z), plus another series in powers of z, involving the digamma function. see olde daalhuis (2010) for details.
around z = 1, if c − a − b is not an integer, one has two independent solutions

  again, when the conditions of non-integrality are not met, there exist other solutions that are more complicated.
any 3 of the above 6 solutions satisfy a linear relation as the space of solutions is 2-dimensional, giving (63) = 20 linear relations between them called connection formulas.


=== kummer's 24 solutions ===
a second order fuchsian equation with n singular points has a group of symmetries acting (projectively) on its solutions, isomorphic to the coxeter group dn of order n!2n−1. for the hypergeometric equation n=3, so the group is of order 24 and is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 4 points, and was first described by
kummer. the isomorphism with the symmetric group is accidental and has no analogue for more than 3 singular points, and it is sometimes better to think of the group as an extension of the symmetric group on 3 points (acting as permutations of the 3 singular points) by a klein 4-group (whose elements change the signs of the differences of the exponents at an even number of singular points). kummer's group of 24 transformations is generated by the three transformations taking a solution f(a,b;c;z) to one of

applying kummer's 24=6×4 transformations to the hypergeometric function gives the 6 = 2×3 solutions above corresponding to each of the 2 possible exponents at each of the 3 singular points, each of which appears 4 times because of the identities

  in the special case of λ, μ and ν real, with 0 ≤ λ,μ,ν < 1 then the s-maps are conformal maps of the upper half-plane h to triangles on the riemann sphere, bounded by circular arcs. this mapping is a generalization of the schwarz–christoffel mapping to triangles with circular arcs. the singular points 0,1 and ∞ are sent to the triangle vertices.  the angles of the triangle are πλ, πμ and πν respectively.
furthermore, in the case of λ=1/p, μ=1/q and  ν=1/r for integers p, q, r, then the triangle tiles the sphere, the complex plane or the upper half plane according to whether λ + μ + ν – 1 is positive, zero or negative; and the s-maps are inverse functions of automorphic functions for the triangle group 〈p, q, r〉 = δ(p, q, r).


=== monodromy group ===
the monodromy of a hypergeometric equation describes how fundamental solutions change when analytically continued around paths in the z plane that return to the same point.
that is, when the path winds around a singularity of  2f1, the value of the solutions at the endpoint will differ from the starting point.
two fundamental solutions of the hypergeometric equation are related to each other by a linear transformation; thus the monodromy is a mapping (group homomorphism):

  where π1 is the fundamental group. in other words, the monodromy is a two dimensional linear representation of the fundamental group. the monodromy group of the equation is the image of this map, i.e. the group generated by the monodromy matrices. the monodromy representation of the fundamental group can be computed explicitly in terms of the exponents at the singular points. if (α, α'), (β, β') and  (γ,γ') are the exponents at 0, 1 and ∞, then, taking z0 near 0, the loops around 0 and 1 have monodromy matrices

  provided that z is not a real number such that it is greater than or equal to 1. and can be proved by expanding (1 − zx)−a using the binomial theorem and then integrating term by term for z with absolute value smaller than 1, and by analytic continuation elsewhere.  when z is a real number greater than or equal to 1, analytic continuation must be used because (1 − zx) is zero at some point in the support of the integral, so the value of the integral may be ill-defined.  this was given by euler in 1748 and implies euler's and pfaff's hypergeometric transformations.
other representations, corresponding to other branches, are given by taking the same integrand, but taking the path of integration to be a closed pochhammer cycle enclosing the singularities in various orders.  such paths correspond to the monodromy action.

== values at special points z ==
see slater (1966, appendix iii) for a list of summation formulas at special points, most of which also appear in bailey (1935).  gessel & stanton (1982) gives further evaluations at more points. koepf (1995) shows how most of these identities can be verified by computer algorithms.
