in algebra, the center of a ring r is the subring consisting of the elements x such that xy = yx for all elements y in r. it is a commutative ring and is denoted as 
  
    
      
        z
        (
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle z(r)}
  ; "z" stands for the german word zentrum, meaning "center".
if r is a ring, then r is an associative algebra over its center. conversely, if r is an associative algebra over a commutative subring s, then s is a subring of the center of r, and if s happens to be the center of r, then the algebra r is called a central algebra.

the center of a skew-field is a field.
the center of the (full) matrix ring with entries in a commutative ring r consists of r-scalar multiples of the identity matrix.
let f be a field extension of a field k, and r an algebra over k. then 
  
    
      
        z
        
          (
          
            r
            
              ⊗
              
                k
              
            
            f
          
          )
        
        =
        z
        (
        r
        )
        
          ⊗
          
            k
          
        
        f
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle z\left(r\otimes _{k}f\right)=z(r)\otimes _{k}f.}
  
the center of the universal enveloping algebra of a lie algebra plays an important role in the representation theory of lie algebras. for example, a casimir element is an element of such a center that is used to analyze lie algebra representations. 
the center of a simple algebra is a field.
