in numerical analysis, finite-difference methods (fdm) are a class of numerical techniques for solving differential equations by approximating derivatives with finite differences. both the spatial domain and time interval (if applicable) are discretized, or broken into a finite number of steps, and the value of the solution at these discrete points is approximated by solving algebraic equations containing finite differences and values from nearby points.
finite difference methods convert ordinary differential equations (ode) or partial differential equations (pde), which may be nonlinear, into a system of linear equations that can be solved by matrix algebra techniques. modern computers can perform these linear algebra computations efficiently which, along with their relative ease of implementation, has led to the widespread use of fdm in modern numerical analysis.
today, fdm are one of the most common approaches to the numerical solution of pde, along with finite element methods.

  where n! denotes the factorial of n, and rn(x) is a remainder term, denoting the difference between the taylor polynomial of degree n and the original function. we will derive an approximation for the first derivative of the function "f" by first truncating the taylor polynomial:

  except for the limit towards zero (the method is named after this).


== accuracy and order ==

the error in a method's solution is defined as the difference between the approximation and the exact analytical solution. the two sources of error in finite difference methods are round-off error, the loss of precision due to computer rounding of decimal quantities, and truncation error or discretization error, the difference between the exact solution of the original differential equation and the exact quantity assuming perfect arithmetic (that is, assuming no round-off).

to use a finite difference method to approximate the solution to a problem, one must first discretize the problem's domain. this is usually done by dividing the domain into a uniform grid (see image to the right). this means that finite-difference methods produce sets of discrete numerical approximations to the derivative, often in a "time-stepping" manner.
an expression of general interest is the local truncation error of a method. typically expressed using big-o notation, local truncation error refers to the error from a single application of a method. that is, it is the quantity

  and further noting that the quantity on the left is the approximation from the finite difference method and that the quantity on the right is the exact quantity of interest plus a remainder, clearly that remainder is the local truncation error. a final expression of this example and its order is:

    {\displaystyle {\frac {f(x_{0}+ih)-f(x_{0})}{ih}}=f'(x_{0})+o(h).}
  this means that, in this case, the local truncation error is proportional to the step sizes. the quality and duration of simulated fdm solution depends on the discretization equation selection and the step sizes (time and space steps). the data quality and simulation duration increase significantly with smaller step size. therefore, a reasonable balance between data quality and simulation duration is necessary for practical usage. large time steps are useful for increasing simulation speed in practice. however, time steps which are too large may create instabilities and affect the data quality.the von neumann and courant-friedrichs-lewy criteria are often evaluated to determine the numerical model stability.

=== comparison ===
to summarize, usually the crank–nicolson scheme is the most accurate scheme for small time steps. for larger time steps, the implicit scheme works better since it is less computationally demanding. the explicit scheme is the least accurate and can be unstable, but is also the easiest to implement and the least numerically intensive. 
here is an example. the figures below present the solutions given by the above methods to approximate the heat equation

  with the boundary condition

    {\displaystyle u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0.}
  the exact solution is

for an equidistant grid one gets a toeplitz matrix.
the 2d case shows all the characteristics of the more general nd case. each second partial derivative needs to be approximated similar to the 1d case

=== consistency ===
consistency of the above-mentioned approximation can be shown for highly regular functions, such as 
  
    
      
        u
        ∈
        
          c
          
            4
          
        
        (
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in c^{4}(\omega )}
  .
the statement is

  
    
      
        δ
        u
        −
        
          δ
          
            h
          
        
        u
        =
        
          
            o
          
        
        (
        
          h
          
            2
          
        
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta u-\delta _{h}u={\mathcal {o}}(h^{2})\,.}
  to prove this, one needs to substitute taylor series expansions up to order 3 into the discrete laplace operator.

==== subharmonic ====
similar to continuous subharmonic functions one can define subharmonic functions for finite-difference approximations

            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{h}}
  

  
    
      
        −

            h
          
        
        
          u
          
            h
          
        
        ≤
        0

  where the approximation is evaluated on points of the grid, and the stencil is assumed to be of positive type.
a similar mean value property also holds for the continuous case.


==== maximum principle ====
for a (discrete) subharmonic function

            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{h}}
   the following holds

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \max _{\omega _{h}}u_{h}\leq \max _{\partial \omega _{h}}u_{h}\,,}
  where

    {\displaystyle \omega _{h},\partial \omega _{h}}
   are discretizations of the continuous domain 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  , respectively the boundary 
  
    
      
        ∂
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \partial \omega }
  .
a similar maximum principle also holds for the continuous case.


== the sbp-sat method ==
the sbp-sat method is a stable and accurate technique for discretizing and imposing boundary conditions of a well-posed partial differential equation using high order finite differences. the method is based on finite differences where the differentiation operators exhibit summation-by-parts properties. typically, these operators consist of differentiation matrices with central difference stencils in the interior with carefully chosen one-sided boundary stencils designed to mimic integration-by-parts in the discrete setting. using the sat technique, the boundary conditions of the pde are imposed weakly, where the boundary values are "pulled" towards the desired conditions rather than exactly fulfilled. if the tuning parameters (inherent to the sat technique) are chosen properly, the resulting system of ode's will exhibit similar energy behavior as the continuous pde, i.e. the system has no non-physical energy growth. this guarantees stability if an integration scheme with a stability region that includes parts of the imaginary axis, such as the fourth order runge-kutta method, is used. this makes the sat technique an attractive method of imposing boundary conditions for higher order finite difference methods, in contrast to for example the injection method, which typically will not be stable if high order differentiation operators are used.
