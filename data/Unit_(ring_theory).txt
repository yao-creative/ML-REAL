in algebra, a unit of a ring is an invertible element for the multiplication of the ring. that is, an element u of a ring r is a unit if there exists v in r such that

  
    
      
        v
        u
        =
        u
        v
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle vu=uv=1}
  ,where 1 is the multiplicative identity; the element v is unique for this property and is called the multiplicative inverse of u. the set of units of r forms a group r× under multiplication, called the group of units or unit group of r.  other notations for the unit group are r∗, u(r), and e(r) (from the german term einheit).
less commonly, the term unit is sometimes used to refer to the element 1 of the ring, in expressions like ring with a unit or unit ring, and also unit matrix. because of this ambiguity, 1 is more commonly called the "unity" or the "identity" of the ring, and the phrases "ring with unity" or a "ring with identity" may be used to emphasize that one is considering a ring instead of a rng.


== examples ==
the multiplicative identity 1 and its additive inverse −1 are always units.  more generally, any root of unity in a ring r is a unit: if rn = 1, then rn − 1 is a multiplicative inverse of r.
in a nonzero ring, the element 0 is not a unit, so r× is not closed under addition.
a nonzero ring r in which every nonzero element is a unit (that is, r× = r −{0}) is called a division ring (or a skew-field). a commutative division ring is called a field. for example, the unit group of the field of real numbers r is r − {0}.


=== integer ring ===
in the ring of integers z, the only units are 1 and −1.
in the ring z/nz of integers modulo n, the units are the congruence classes (mod n) represented by integers coprime to n. they constitute the multiplicative group of integers modulo n.


=== ring of integers of a number field ===
in the ring z[√3] obtained by adjoining the quadratic integer √3 to z, one has (2 + √3)(2 - √3) = 1, so 2 + √3 is a unit, and so are its powers, so z[√3] has infinitely many units.
more generally, for the ring of integers r in a number field f, dirichlet's unit theorem states that r× is isomorphic to the group 

  
    
      
        
          
            z
          
          
            n
          
        
        ×
        
          μ
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {z} ^{n}\times \mu _{r}}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{r}}
   is the (finite, cyclic) group of roots of unity in r and n, the rank of the unit group, is

  
    
      
        n
        =
        
          r
          
            1
          
        
        +
        
          r
          
            2
          
        
        −
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=r_{1}+r_{2}-1,}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          r
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{1},r_{2}}
   are the number of real embeddings and the number of pairs of complex embeddings of f, respectively.
this recovers the z[√3] example: the unit group of (the ring of integers of) a real quadratic field is infinite of rank 1, since 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            1
          
        
        =
        2
        ,
        
          r
          
            2
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{1}=2,r_{2}=0}
  .


=== polynomials and power series ===
for a commutative ring r, the units of the polynomial ring r[x] are the polynomials

  
    
      
        p
        (
        x
        )
        =

    {\displaystyle p(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+\dots a_{n}x^{n}}
  such that 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{0}}
   is a unit in r and the remaining coefficients 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{1},\dots ,a_{n}}
   are nilpotent, i.e., satisfy 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i

        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{i}^{n}=0}
   for some n.
in particular, if r is a domain, then the units of r[x] are the units of r.
the units of the power series ring 
  
    
      
        r
        [
        [
        x
        ]
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle r[[x]]}
   are the power series

  
    
      
        p
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            =

            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p(x)=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }a_{i}x^{i}}
  such that 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{0}}
   is a unit in r.


=== matrix rings ===
the unit group of the ring mn(r) of n × n matrices over a ring r is the group gln(r) of invertible matrices.  for a commutative ring r, an element a of mn(r) is invertible if and only if the determinant of a is invertible in r.  in that case, a−1 can be given explicitly in terms of the adjugate matrix.


=== in general ===
for elements x and y in a ring r, if 
  
    
      
        1
        −
        x
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1-xy}
   is invertible, then

        −
        y
        x

    {\displaystyle 1+y(1-xy)^{-1}x}
  ; this formula can be guessed, but not proved, by the following calculation in a ring of noncommutative power series:

        1
        −

== group of units ==
a commutative ring is a local ring if r − r× is a maximal ideal.
as it turns out, if r − r× is an ideal, then it is necessarily a maximal ideal and r is local since a maximal ideal is disjoint from r×.
if r is a finite field, then r× is a cyclic group of order 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        r

        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle |r|-1}
  .
every ring homomorphism f : r → s induces a group homomorphism r× → s×, since f maps units to units.  in fact, the formation of the unit group defines a functor from the category of rings to the category of groups.  this functor has a left adjoint which is the integral group ring construction.the group scheme

        )

  . note that the functor

        (
        r

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {g} _{m}(r)\simeq \operatorname {hom} (\mathbb {z} [t,t^{-1}],r)}
   for commutative rings r (this for instance follows from the aforementioned adjoint relation with the group ring construction). explicitly this means that there is a natural bijection between the set of the ring homomorphisms

        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} [t,t^{-1}]\to r}
   and the set of unit elements of r (in contrast,

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {g} _{a}}
  , the forgetful functor from the category of commutative rings to the category of abelian groups).


== associatedness ==
suppose that r is commutative.  elements r and s of r are called associate if there exists a unit u in r such that r = us; then write r ∼ s.  in any ring, pairs of additive inverse elements x and −x are associate.  for example, 6 and −6 are associate in z.  in general, ~ is an equivalence relation on r.
associatedness can also be described in terms of the action of r× on r via multiplication: two elements of r are associate if they are in the same r×-orbit.
in an integral domain, the set of associates of a given nonzero element has the same cardinality as r×.
the equivalence relation ~ can be viewed as any one of green's semigroup relations specialized to the multiplicative semigroup of a commutative ring r.
