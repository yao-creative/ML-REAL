many mathematical problems have not yet been solved. these unsolved problems occur in multiple domains, including theoretical physics, computer science, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, algebraic, differential, discrete and euclidean geometries, graph, group, model, number, set and ramsey theories, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. some problems may belong to more than one discipline of mathematics and be studied using techniques from different areas. prizes are often awarded for the solution to a long-standing problem, and lists of unsolved problems, such as the list of millennium prize problems, receive considerable attention.
this article is a composite of notable unsolved problems derived from many sources, including but not limited to lists considered authoritative. the list is not comprehensive, for at least the reason that entries may not be updated at the time of viewing. this list includes problems which are considered by the mathematical community to be widely varying in both difficulty and centrality to the science as a whole.


== lists of unsolved problems in mathematics ==
various mathematicians and organizations have published and promoted lists of unsolved mathematical problems. in some cases, the lists have been associated with prizes for the discoverers of solutions.


=== millennium prize problems ===
of the original seven millennium prize problems set by the clay mathematics institute in 2000, six have yet to be solved as of august, 2021:
birch and swinnerton-dyer conjecture
hodge conjecture
navier–stokes existence and smoothness
p versus np
riemann hypothesis
yang–mills existence and mass gapthe seventh problem, the poincaré conjecture, has been solved; however, a generalization called the smooth four-dimensional poincaré conjecture—that is, whether a four-dimensional topological sphere can have two or more inequivalent smooth structures—is still unsolved.
