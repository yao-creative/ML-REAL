in mathematics, in the fields of multilinear algebra and representation theory, the principal invariants of the second rank tensor 
  
    
      
        
          a
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
   are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial

  
    
      
         
        p
        (
        λ
        )
        =
        det
        (
        
          a
        
        −
        λ
        
          i
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ p(\lambda )=\det(\mathbf {a} -\lambda \mathbf {i} )}
  ,where 
  
    
      
        
          i
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {i} }
   is the identity operator and 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            i
          
        
        ∈
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{i}\in \mathbb {c} }
   represent the polynomial's eigenvalues.
more broadly, any scalar-valued function 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          a
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {a} )}
   is an invariant of 
  
    
      
        
          a
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          q
        
        
          a
        
        
          
            q
          
          
            t
          
        
        )
        =
        f
        (
        
          a
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {q} \mathbf {a} \mathbf {q} ^{t})=f(\mathbf {a} )}
   for all orthogonal 
  
    
      
        
          q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} }
  . this means that a formula expressing an invariant in terms of components, 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{ij}}
  , will give the same result for all cartesian bases. for example, even though individual diagonal components of 
  
    
      
        
          a
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
   will change with a change in basis, the sum of diagonal components will not change.


== properties ==
the principal invariants do not change with rotations of the coordinate system (they are objective, or in more modern terminology, satisfy the principle of material frame-indifference) and any function of the principal invariants is also objective.


== calculation of the invariants of rank two  tensors ==
in a majority of engineering applications, the principal invariants of (rank two) tensors of dimension three are sought, such as those for the  right cauchy-green deformation tensor.


=== principal invariants ===
for such tensors  the principal invariants are given by:

=== mixed invariants ===
furthermore, mixed invariants between pairs of rank two tensors may also be defined.


== calculation of the invariants of order two  tensors of higher dimension ==
these may be extracted by evaluating the characteristic polynomial directly, using the faddeev-leverrier algorithm for example.


== calculation of the invariants of higher order tensors ==
the invariants of rank three, four, and higher order tensors may also be determined.

          a
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
  , whereas these distinct three invariants characterize (in a sense) "alignment" between the symmetric and skew parts of 
  
    
      
        
          a
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
  . incidentally, it is a myth that a tensor is positive definite if its eigenvalues are positive. instead, it is positive definite if and only if the eigenvalues of its symmetric part are positive.
