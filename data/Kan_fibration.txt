in mathematics, kan complexes and kan fibrations are part of the theory of simplicial sets. kan fibrations are the fibrations of the standard model category structure on simplicial sets and are therefore of fundamental importance. kan complexes are the fibrant objects in this model category. the name is in honor of daniel kan.

=== definition of the standard n-simplex ===

for each n ≥ 0, recall that the standard 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -simplex, 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n}}
  , is the representable simplicial set

  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
        (
        i
        )
        =
        
          
            h
            o
            m
          
          
            
              δ
            
          
        
        (
        [
        i
        ]
        ,
        [
        n
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n}(i)=\mathrm {hom} _{\mathbf {\delta } }([i],[n])}
  applying the geometric realization functor to this simplicial set gives a space homeomorphic to the topological standard 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -simplex: the convex subspace of ℝn+1 consisting of all points 
  
    
      
        (
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          t
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t_{0},\dots ,t_{n})}
   such that the coordinates are non-negative and sum to 1.


=== definition of a horn ===

for each k ≤ n, this has a subcomplex 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            k
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{k}^{n}}
  , the k-th horn inside 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n}}
  , corresponding to the boundary of the n-simplex, with the k-th face removed. this may be formally defined in various ways, as for instance the union of the images of the n maps 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
        →
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n-1}\rightarrow \delta ^{n}}
   corresponding to all the other faces of 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n}}
  . horns of the form 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            k
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{k}^{2}}
   sitting inside

    {\displaystyle \delta ^{2}}
   look like the black v at the top of the adjacent image. if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a simplicial set, then maps

  
    
      
        s
        :
        
          λ

            n
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle s:\lambda _{k}^{n}\to x}
  correspond to collections of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}

        n
        −
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (n-1)}
  -simplices satisfying a compatibility condition, one for each 
  
    
      
        0
        ≤
        k

=== definition of a kan fibration ===

a map of simplicial sets 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:x\rightarrow y}
   is a kan fibration if, for any 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq 1}
   and 
  
    
      
        0
        ≤
        k
        ≤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq k\leq n}
  , and for any maps 
  
    
      
        s
        :
        
          λ
          
            k
          
          
            n
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle s:\lambda _{k}^{n}\rightarrow x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
        :
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
        →
        y
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y:\delta ^{n}\rightarrow y\,}
   such that 
  
    
      
        f
        ∘
        s
        =
        y
        ∘
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\circ s=y\circ i}
   (where 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   is the inclusion of 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            k

            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n}}
  ), there exists a map 
  
    
      
        x
        :
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x:\delta ^{n}\rightarrow x}
   such that 
  
    
      
        s
        =
        x
        ∘
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle s=x\circ i}
   and 

  
    
      
        y
        =
        f
        ∘
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=f\circ x}
  . stated this way, the definition is very similar to that of fibrations in topology (see also homotopy lifting property), whence the name "fibration".


==== technical remarks ====
using the correspondence between 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -simplices of a simplicial set 
  
    
      
        x

        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n}\to x}
   (a consequence of the yoneda lemma), this definition can be written in terms of simplices. the image of the map 
  
    
      
        f
        s
        :
        
          λ
          
            k
          
          
            n
          
        
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle fs:\lambda _{k}^{n}\to y}
   can be thought of as a horn as described above. asking that 
  
    
      
        f
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle fs}
   factors through 
  
    
      
        y
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle yi}
   corresponds to requiring that there is an 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -simplex in 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   whose faces make up the horn from 
  
    
      
        f
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle fs}
   (together with one other face). then the required map 
  
    
      
        x
        :
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x:\delta ^{n}\to x}
   corresponds to a simplex in 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   whose faces include the horn from 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  . the diagram to the right is an example in two dimensions. since the black v in the lower diagram is filled in by the blue 
  
    
      
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2}
  -simplex, if the black v above maps down to it then the striped blue 
  
    
      
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2}
  -simplex has to exist, along with the dotted blue 
  
    
      
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1}
  -simplex, mapping down in the obvious way.


==== kan complexes defined from kan fibrations ====
a simplicial set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is called a kan complex if the map from 
  
    
      
        x
        →
        {
        ∗
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\to \{*\}}
  , the one-point simplicial set, is a kan fibration. in the model category for simplicial sets, 
  
    
      
        {
        ∗
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{*\}}
   is the terminal object and so a kan complex is exactly the same as a fibrant object. equivalently, this could be stated as: if every map 
  
    
      
        α
        :
        
          λ
          
            k
          
          
            n
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha :\lambda _{k}^{n}\to x}
   from a horn has an extension to 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n}}
  , meaning there is a lift 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              α
              ~
            
          
        
        :
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tilde {\alpha }}:\delta ^{n}\to x}
   such that
  
    
      
        α
        =
        
          
            
              α
              ~
            
          
        
        ∘
        ι
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha ={\tilde {\alpha }}\circ \iota }
  for the inclusion map 
  
    
      
        ι
        :
        
          λ
          
            k
          
          
            n
          
        
        ↪
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \iota :\lambda _{k}^{n}\hookrightarrow \delta ^{n}}
  , then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a kan complex. conversely, every kan complex has this property, hence it gives a simple technical condition for a kan complex.

an important example comes from the construction of singular simplices used to define singular homology, called the singular functorpg 7
  
    
      
        s
        :
        
          top
        
        →
        s
        
          sets
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s:{\text{top}}\to s{\text{sets}}}
  .given a space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , define a singular 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -simplex of x to be a continuous map from the standard topological 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -simplex (as described above) to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  ,

  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:\delta _{n}\to x}
  taking the set of these maps for all non-negative 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   gives a graded set,

  
    
      
        s
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          ∐
          
            n
          
        
        
          s
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s(x)=\coprod _{n}s_{n}(x)}
  .to make this into a simplicial set, define face maps

==== relation with geometric realization ====
it is worth noting the singular functor is right adjoint to the geometric realization functor

        ⋅

        :
        s
        
          sets
        
        →
        
          top
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\cdot |:s{\text{sets}}\to {\text{top}}}
  giving the isomorphism
  
    
      
        
          
            hom
          
          
            top
          
        
        (
        
          |
        
        x

        y
        )
        ≅
        
          
            hom
          
          
            s
            
              sets
            
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        s

=== simplicial sets underlying simplicial groups ===
it can be shown that the simplicial set underlying a simplicial group is always fibrantpg 12. in particular, for a simplicial abelian group, its geometric realization is homotopy equivalent to a product of eilenberg-maclane spaces
  
    
      
        
          ∏
          
            i
            ∈
            i
          
        
        k
        (
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        
          n
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \prod _{i\in i}k(a_{i},n_{i})}
  in particular, this includes classifying spaces. so the spaces 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            1
          
        
        ≃
        k
        (
        
          z
        
        ,
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s^{1}\simeq k(\mathbb {z} ,1)}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
            p
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        ≃
        k
        (
        
          z
        
        ,
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {cp} ^{\infty }\simeq k(\mathbb {z} ,2)}
  , and the infinite lens spaces 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            q
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        ≃
        k
        (
        
          z
        
        
          /
        
        q
        ,
        2
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{q}^{\infty }\simeq k(\mathbb {z} /q,2)}
   are correspond to kan complexes of some simplicial set. in fact, this set can be constructed explicitly using the dold–kan correspondence of a chain complex and taking the underlying simplicial set of the simplicial abelian group.


=== geometric realizations of small groupoids ===
another important source of examples are the simplicial sets associated to a small groupoid 
  
    
      
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {g}}}
  . this is defined as the geometric realization of the simplicial set 
  
    
      
        [
        
          δ
          
            o
            p
          
        
        ,
        
          
            g
          
        
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [\delta ^{op},{\mathcal {g}}]}
   and is typically denoted 
  
    
      
        b
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle b{\mathcal {g}}}
  . we could have also replaced 
  
    
      
        
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {g}}}
   with an infinity groupoid. it is conjectured that the homotopy category of geometric realizations of infinity groupoids is equivalent to the homotopy category of homotopy types. this is called the homotopy hypothesis.


=== non-example: standard n-simplex ===
it turns out the standard 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -simplex 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{n}}
   is not a kan complexpg 38. the construction of a counter example in general can be found by looking at a low dimensional example, say 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta ^{1}}
  . taking the map 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            0
          
          
            2
          
        
        →
        
          δ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{0}^{2}\to \delta ^{1}}
   sending
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                [
                0
                ,
                2
                ]
                ↦
                [
                0
                ,
                0
                ]
              
              
                [
                0
                ,
                1
                ]
                ↦
                [
                0
                ,
                1
                ]
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}[0,2]\mapsto [0,0]&[0,1]\mapsto [0,1]\end{matrix}}}
  gives a counter example since it cannot be extended to a map 
  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            2
          
        
        →
        
          δ
          
            1

=== homotopy groups of kan complexes ===
the homotopy groups of a fibrant simplicial set may be defined combinatorially, using horns, in a way that agrees with the homotopy groups of the topological space which realizes it. for a kan complex

  defining the group structure requires a little more work. essentially, given two maps

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega :\delta ^{n+1}\to x}

==== homotopy groups of simplicial sets ====
using model categories, any simplicial set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has a fibrant replacement 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}
   which is homotopy equivalent to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in the homotopy category of simplicial sets. then, the homotopy groups of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   can be defined as
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        x
        )
        :=
        
          π
          
            n
          
        
        (
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
        ,
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{n}(x,x):=\pi _{n}({\hat {x}},{\hat {x}})}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}
   is a lift of 
  
    
      
        x
        :
        
          δ
          
            0
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x:\delta ^{0}\to x}
   to 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}
  . these fibrant replacements can be thought of a topological analogue of resolutions of a chain complex (such as a projective resolution or a flat resolution).
