in mathematics, more specifically in ring theory, a cyclic module or monogenous module is a module over a ring that is generated by one element.  the concept is analogous to cyclic group, that is, a group that is generated by one element.


== definition ==
a left r-module m is called cyclic if m can be generated by a single element i.e. m = (x) = rx = {rx | r ∈ r} for some x in m. similarly, a right r-module n is cyclic if n = yr for some y ∈ n.


== examples ==
2z as a z-module is a cyclic module.
in fact, every cyclic group is a cyclic z-module.
every simple r-module m is a cyclic module since the submodule generated by any non-zero element x of m is necessarily the whole module m. in general, a module is simple if and only if it is nonzero and is generated by each of its nonzero elements.
if the ring r is considered as a left module over itself, then its cyclic submodules are exactly its left principal ideals as a ring. the same holds for r as a right r-module, mutatis mutandis.
if r is f[x], the ring of polynomials over a field f, and v is an r-module which is also a finite-dimensional vector space over f, then the jordan blocks of x acting on v are cyclic submodules.  (the jordan blocks are all isomorphic to f[x] / (x − λ)n; there may also be other cyclic submodules with different annihilators; see below.)


== properties ==
given a cyclic r-module m that is generated by x, there exists a canonical isomorphism between m and r / annr x, where annr x denotes the annihilator of x in r.every module is a sum of cyclic submodules.
