in set theory, the union (denoted by ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all elements in the collection. it is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other. 
a nullary union refers to a union of  zero (
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
  ) sets and it is by definition equal to the empty set.

== union of two sets ==
the union of two sets a and b is the set of elements which are in a, in b, or in both a and b.  in symbols,

  
    
      
        a
        ∪
        b
        =
        {
        x
        :
        x
        ∈
        a
        
           or 
        
        x
        ∈
        b
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\cup b=\{x:x\in a{\text{  or  }}x\in b\}}
  .for example, if a = {1, 3, 5, 7} and b = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} then a ∪ b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.  a more elaborate example (involving two infinite sets) is:

a = {x is an even integer larger than 1}
b = {x is an odd integer larger than 1}

  
    
      
        a
        ∪
        b
        =
        {
        2
        ,
        3
        ,
        4
        ,
        5
        ,
        6
        ,
        …
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\cup b=\{2,3,4,5,6,\dots \}}
  as another example, the number 9 is not contained in the union of the set of prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} and the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}, because 9 is neither prime nor even.
sets cannot have duplicate elements, so the union of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}. multiple occurrences of identical elements have no effect on the cardinality of a set or its contents.


== algebraic properties ==

binary union is an associative operation; that is, for any sets 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
        ,
        
           and 
        
        c
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,b,{\text{ and }}c,}
  

thus the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity: either of the above can be written as 
  
    
      
        a
        ∪
        b
        ∪
        c
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\cup b\cup c.}
   also, union is commutative, so the sets can be written in any order.
the empty set is an identity element for the operation of union. that is, 
  
    
      
        a
        ∪
        ∅
        =
        a
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\cup \varnothing =a,}
   for any set 
  
    
      
        a
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a.}
   also, the union operation is idempotent: 
  
    
      
        a
        ∪
        a
        =
        a
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\cup a=a.}
    all these properties follow from analogous facts about logical disjunction.
intersection distributes over union
 
and union distributes over intersection
the power set of a set 
  
    
      
        u
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle u,}
   together with the operations given by union, intersection, and complementation, is a boolean algebra.  in this boolean algebra, union can be expressed in terms of intersection and complementation by the formula

where the superscript 
  
    
      
        
          

          
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {}^{\text{c}}}
   denotes the complement in the universal set 
  
    
      
        u
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle u.}
  


== finite unions ==
one can take the union of several sets simultaneously.  for example, the union of three sets a, b, and c contains all elements of a, all elements of b, and all elements of c, and nothing else. thus, x is an element of a ∪ b ∪ c if and only if x is in at least one of a, b, and c.
a finite union is the union of a finite number of sets; the phrase does not imply that the union set is a finite set.


== arbitrary unions ==
the most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets, sometimes called an infinitary union. if m is a set or class whose elements are sets, then x is an element of the union of m if and only if there is at least one element a of m such that x is an element of a. in symbols:

  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        ⋃
        
          m
        
        
        ⟺
        
        ∃
        a
        ∈
        
          m
        
        ,
         
        x
        ∈
        a
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in \bigcup \mathbf {m} \iff \exists a\in \mathbf {m} ,\ x\in a.}
  this idea subsumes the preceding sections—for example, a ∪ b ∪ c is the union of the collection {a, b, c}. also, if m is the empty collection, then the union of m is the empty set.


=== notations ===
the notation for the general concept can vary considerably.  for a finite union of sets 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          s
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        
          s
          
            3
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          s
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\dots ,s_{n}}
   one often writes 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            1
          
        
        ∪
        
          s

        ∪
        
          s
          
            3
          
        
        ∪
        ⋯
        ∪
        
          s
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{1}\cup s_{2}\cup s_{3}\cup \dots \cup s_{n}}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          s
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{n}s_{i}}
  .  various common notations for arbitrary unions include  
  
    
      
        ⋃
        
          m
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup \mathbf {m} }
  , 
  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            a
            ∈
            
              m
            
          
        
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{a\in \mathbf {m} }a}
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            ∈
            i
          
        
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i\in i}a_{i}}
  . the last of these notations refers to the union of the collection 
  
    
      
        
          {
          
            
              a
              
                i
              
            
            :
            i
            ∈
            i
          
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{a_{i}:i\in i\right\}}
  , where i is an index set and 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{i}}
   is a set for every 
  
    
      
        i
        ∈
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\in i}
  . in the case that the index set i is the set of natural numbers, one uses the notation 
  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }a_{i}}
  , which is analogous to that of the infinite sums in series.when the symbol "∪" is placed before other symbols (instead of between them), it is usually rendered as a larger size.


== notation encoding ==
in unicode, union is represented by the character u+222a ∪ union. in tex, 
  
    
      
        ∪
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cup }
   is rendered from \cup.
