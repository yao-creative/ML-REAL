in functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, locally convex topological vector spaces (lctvs) or locally convex spaces are examples of topological vector spaces (tvs) that generalize normed spaces. they can be defined as topological vector spaces whose topology is generated by translations of balanced, absorbent, convex sets. alternatively they can be defined as a vector space with a family of seminorms, and a topology can be defined in terms of that family. although in general such spaces are not necessarily normable, the existence of a convex local base for the zero vector is strong enough for the hahn–banach theorem to hold, yielding a sufficiently rich theory of continuous linear functionals.
fréchet spaces are locally convex spaces that are completely metrizable (with a choice of complete metric). they are generalizations of banach spaces, which are complete vector spaces with respect to a metric generated by a norm.


== history ==
metrizable topologies on vector spaces have been studied since their introduction in maurice fréchet's 1902 phd thesis sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel (wherein the notion of a metric was first introduced). 
after the notion of a general topological space was defined by felix hausdorff in 1914, although locally convex topologies were implicitly used by some mathematicians, up to 1934 only john von neumann would seem to have explicitly defined the weak topology on hilbert spaces and strong operator topology on operators on hilbert spaces. finally, in 1935 von neumann introduced the general definition of a locally convex space (called a convex space by him).a notable example of a result which had to wait for the development and dissemination of general locally convex spaces (amongst other notions and results, like nets, the product topology and tychonoff's theorem) to be proven in its full generality, is the banach–alaoglu theorem which stefan banach first established in 1932 by an elementary diagonal argument for the case of separable normed spaces (in which case the unit ball of the dual is metrizable).

  a topological vector space (tvs) is called locally convex if the origin has a neighborhood basis (that is, a local base) consisting of convex sets.in fact, every locally convex tvs has a neighborhood basis of the origin consisting of absolutely convex sets (that is, disks), where this neighborhood basis can further be chosen to also consist entirely of open sets or entirely of closed sets. 
every tvs has a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of balanced sets but only a locally convex tvs has a neighborhood basis at the origin consisting of sets that are both balanced and convex. it is possible for a tvs to have some neighborhoods of the origin that are convex and yet not be locally convex.
because translation is (by definition of "topological vector space") continuous, all translations are homeomorphisms, so every base for the neighborhoods of the origin can be translated to a base for the neighborhoods of any given vector.

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   induces a canonical vector space topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , called the initial topology induced by the seminorms, making it into a topological vector space (tvs). by definition, it is the coarsest topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   for which all maps in 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {p}}}
   are continuous.
that the vector space operations are continuous in this topology follows from properties 2 and 3 above. 
it can easily be seen that the resulting topological vector space is "locally convex" in the sense of the first definition given above because each 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            b
            ,
            r
          
        
        (
        0
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{b,r}(0)}
   is absolutely convex and absorbent (and because the latter properties are preserved by translations).
it is possible for a locally convex topology on a space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to be induced by a family of norms but for 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to not be normable (that is, to have its topology be induced by a single norm).


===== basis and subbasis =====

a subbasis at the origin is given by all sets of the form

        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
   ranges over the positive real numbers. 
a base at the origin is given by the collection of all possible finite intersections of such subbasis sets.
recall that the topology of a tvs is translation invariant, meaning that if 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is any subset of 
  
    
      
        x

   containing the origin then for any

        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is a neighborhood of the origin if and only if 
  
    
      
        x

        s

   is a neighborhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}

thus it suffices to define the topology at the origin. 
a base of neighborhoods of

the following theorem implies that if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   can be a defined by a family of continuous  norms  on 
  
    
      
        x

   (a norm is a seminorm

   where

        =

        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . this is because the sum of a norm and a seminorm is a norm so if a locally convex space is defined by some family 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {p}}}
   of seminorms (each of which is necessarily continuous) then the family

if there exists a continuous norm on a topological vector space

   then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is necessarily hausdorff but the converse is not in general true (not even for locally convex spaces or fréchet spaces).

=== equivalence of definitions ===
although the definition in terms of a neighborhood base gives a better geometric picture, the definition in terms of seminorms is easier to work with in practice.

    a locally convex space is hausdorff if and only if it has a separated family of seminorms.  many authors take the hausdorff criterion in the definition.
a pseudometric is a generalization of a metric which does not satisfy the condition that 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        x
        ,

   only when

    {\displaystyle x=y.}
    a locally convex space is pseudometrizable, meaning that its topology arises from a pseudometric, if and only if it has a countable family of seminorms.  indeed, a pseudometric inducing the same topology is then given by  (where the

          /

   can be replaced by any positive summable sequence 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{n}}
  ). this pseudometric is translation-invariant, but not homogeneous, meaning 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        k
        x
        ,

        ≠

        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(kx,ky)\neq |k|d(x,y),}
   and therefore does not define a (pseudo)norm. the pseudometric is an honest metric if and only if the family of seminorms is separated, since this is the case if and only if the space is hausdorff. if furthermore the space is complete, the space is called a fréchet space.
as with any topological vector space, a locally convex space is also a uniform space.  thus one may speak of uniform continuity, uniform convergence, and cauchy sequences.
a cauchy net  in a locally convex space is a net 
  
    
      
        
          
            (

   such that for every 
  
    
      
        r
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle r>0}
   and every seminorm 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            α
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\alpha },}
   there exists some index 
  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in a}
   such that for all indices 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b

    in other words, the net must be cauchy in all the seminorms simultaneously.  the definition of completeness is given here in terms of nets instead of the more familiar sequences because unlike fréchet spaces which are metrizable, general spaces may be defined by an uncountable family of pseudometrics.  sequences, which are countable by definition, cannot suffice to characterize convergence in such spaces.  a locally convex space is complete if and only if every cauchy net converges.
a family of seminorms becomes a preordered set under the relation 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            α

            β
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\alpha }\leq p_{\beta }}
   if and only if there exists an 
  
    
      
        m
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m>0}
   such that for all 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            α
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        ≤
        m
        
          p
          
            β

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\alpha }(x)\leq mp_{\beta }(x).}
   one says it is a directed family of seminorms if the family is a directed set with addition as the join, in other words if for every 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   and 
  
    
      
        β
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta ,}
   there is a 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            α
          
        
        +
        
          p

    {\displaystyle p_{\alpha }+p_{\beta }\leq p_{\gamma }.}
    every family of seminorms has an equivalent directed family, meaning one which defines the same topology.  indeed, given a family 
  
    
      
        
          
            (

                  α
                
              
              (

   let

   be the set of finite subsets of

    {\displaystyle i}
   and then for every 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\in \phi }
   define  one may check that 
  
    
      
        
          
            (

    {\displaystyle \left(q_{f}\right)_{f\in \phi }}
   is an equivalent directed family.
if the topology of the space is induced from a single seminorm, then the space is seminormable. any locally convex space with a finite family of seminorms is seminormable. moreover, if the space is hausdorff (the family is separated), then the space is normable, with norm given by the sum of the seminorms. in terms of the open sets, a locally convex topological vector space is seminormable if and only if the origin has a bounded neighborhood.

in a quasi-complete locally convex tvs, the closure of the convex hull of a compact subset is again compact.
in a hausdorff locally convex tvs, the convex hull of a precompact set is again precompact. consequently, in a complete locally convex hausdorff tvs, the closed convex hull of a compact subset is again compact.
in any tvs, the convex hull of a finite union of compact convex sets is compact (and convex).this implies that in any hausdorff tvs, the convex hull of a finite union of compact convex sets is closed (in addition to being compact and convex); in particular, the convex hull of such a union is equal to the closed convex hull of that union.
in general, the closed convex hull of a compact set is not necessarily compact.
in any non-hausdorff tvs, there exist subsets that are compact (and thus complete) but not closed.

=== finest and coarsest locally convex topology ===


==== coarsest vector topology ====
any vector space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   endowed with the trivial topology (also called the indiscrete topology) is a locally convex tvs (and of course, it is the coarsest such topology). 
this topology is hausdorff if and only 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        {
        0
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\{0\}.}
   
the indiscrete topology makes any vector space into a complete pseudometrizable locally convex tvs.
in contrast, the discrete topology forms a vector topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   if and only 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        {
        0
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=\{0\}.}
  
this follows from the fact that every topological vector space is a connected space.

=== examples of locally convex spaces ===
every normed space is a hausdorff locally convex space, and much of the theory of locally convex spaces generalizes parts of the theory of normed spaces. 
the family of seminorms can be taken to be the single norm. 
every banach space is a complete hausdorff locally convex space, in particular, the

a fréchet space can be defined as a complete locally convex space with a separated countable family of seminorms.

=== examples of spaces lacking local convexity ===
many topological vector spaces are locally convex. examples of spaces that lack local convexity include the following:

the spaces 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            p
          
        
        (
        [

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{p}([0,1])}
   for 
  
    
      
        0

        p
        <
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0<p<1}
   are equipped with the f-norm  they are not locally convex, since the only convex neighborhood of zero is the whole space. more generally the spaces 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            p
          
        
        (
        μ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle l^{p}(\mu )}
   with an atomless, finite measure 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   and

        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0<p<1}
   are not locally convex.
the space of measurable functions on the unit interval 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1]}
   (where we identify two functions that are equal almost everywhere) has a vector-space topology defined by the translation-invariant metric (which induces the convergence in measure of measurable functions; for random variables, convergence in measure is convergence in probability):  this space is often denoted 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{0}.}
  both examples have the property that any continuous linear map to the real numbers is 
  
    
      
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0.}
   in particular, their dual space is trivial, that is, it contains only the zero functional.

the sequence space

    {\displaystyle 0<p<1,}
   is not locally convex.


== continuous mappings ==

because locally convex spaces are topological spaces as well as vector spaces, the natural functions to consider between two locally convex spaces are continuous linear maps. 
using the seminorms, a necessary and sufficient criterion for the continuity of a linear map can be given that closely resembles the more familiar boundedness condition found for banach spaces.
