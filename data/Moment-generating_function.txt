in probability theory and statistics, the moment-generating function of a real-valued random variable is an alternative specification of its probability distribution. thus, it provides the basis of an alternative route to analytical results compared with working directly with probability density functions or cumulative distribution functions. there are particularly simple results for the moment-generating functions of distributions defined by the weighted sums of random variables. however, not all random variables have moment-generating functions.
as its name implies, the moment generating function can be used to compute a distribution’s moments: the nth moment about 0 is the nth derivative of the moment-generating function, evaluated at 0.
in addition to real-valued distributions (univariate distributions), moment-generating functions can be defined for vector- or matrix-valued random variables, and can even be extended to more general cases.
the moment-generating function of a real-valued distribution does not always exist, unlike the characteristic function. there are relations between the behavior of the moment-generating function of a distribution and properties of the distribution, such as the existence of moments.

   always exists and is equal to 1. however, a key problem with moment-generating functions is that moments and the moment-generating function may not exist, as the integrals need not converge absolutely. by contrast, the characteristic function or fourier transform always exists (because it is the integral of a bounded function on a space of finite measure), and for some purposes may be used instead.
the moment-generating function is so named because it can be used to find the moments of the distribution.  the series expansion of

== examples ==
here are some examples of the moment-generating function and the characteristic function for comparison. it can be seen that the characteristic function is a wick rotation of the moment-generating function 
  
    
      
        
          m

== calculation ==
the moment-generating function is the expectation of a function of the random variable, it can be written as:

== important properties ==
moment generating functions are positive and log-convex, with m(0) = 1.
an important property of the moment-generating function is that it uniquely determines the distribution. in other words, if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and

   are two random variables and for all values of t,

  may not exist. the log-normal distribution is an example of when this occurs.


=== calculations of moments ===
the moment-generating function is so called because if it exists on an open interval around t = 0, then it is the exponential generating function of the moments of the probability distribution:

  
    
      
        
          m
          
            n
          
        
        =
        e
        
          (
          
            x
            
              n
            
          
          )
        
        =
        
          m
          
            x
          
          
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        (
        0
        )
        =
        
          
            
            
              
                
                  
                    d
                    
                      n
                    
                  
                  
                    m
                    
                      x
                    
                  
                
                
                  d
                  
                    t
                    
                      n
                    
                  
                
              
            
            |
          
          
            t
            =
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{n}=e\left(x^{n}\right)=m_{x}^{(n)}(0)=\left.{\frac {d^{n}m_{x}}{dt^{n}}}\right|_{t=0}.}
  that is, with n being a nonnegative integer, the nth moment about 0 is the nth derivative of the moment generating function, evaluated at t = 0.


== other properties ==
jensen's inequality provides a simple lower bound on the moment-generating function:

  
    
      
        
          m
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        ≥
        
          e
          
            μ
            t
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{x}(t)\geq e^{\mu t},}
  where 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   is the mean of x.
the moment-generating function can be used in conjunction with markov's inequality to give an bound the upper tail of a real random variable x. this statement is also called the chernoff bound. since 
  
    
      
        x
        ↦
        
          e

    {\displaystyle x\mapsto e^{xt}}

        t

        0

    {\displaystyle p(x\geq a)=p(e^{tx}\geq e^{ta})\leq e^{-at}e[e^{tx}]=e^{-at}m_{x}(t)}
  for any 
  
    
      
        t
        >
        0

          m
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{x}(t)}
   exists.  for example, when x is a standard normal distribution and 
  
    
      
        a
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a>0}
  , we can choose 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=a}
   and recall that 
  
    
      
        
          m
          
            x

        =

              t

    {\displaystyle m_{x}(t)=e^{t^{2}/2}}

        p
        (
        x

    {\displaystyle p(x\geq a)\leq e^{-a^{2}/2}}
  , which is within a factor of 1+a of the exact value.
various lemmas, such as hoeffding's lemma or bennett's inequality provide bounds on the moment-generating function in the case of a zero-mean, bounded random variable.
when 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is non-negative, the moment generating function gives a simple, useful bound on the moments:

  
    
      
        e
        [
        
          x
          
            m
          
        
        ]
        ≤
        
          
            (
            
              
                m
                
                  t
                  e
                
              
            
            )
          
          
            m
          
        
        
          m
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle e[x^{m}]\leq \left({\frac {m}{te}}\right)^{m}m_{x}(t),}
  for any 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        m
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,m\geq 0}
   and 
  
    
      
        t
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle t>0}
  .
this follows from the simple inequality 
  
    
      
        1
        +
        x
        ≤
        
          e
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1+x\leq e^{x}}
   into which we can substitute 
  
    
      
        
          x
          ′
        
        =
        t
        x
        
          /
        
        m
        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle x'=tx/m-1}
   implies 
  
    
      
        t
        x
        
          /
        
        m
        ≤
        
          e
          
            t
            x
            
              /
            
            m
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle tx/m\leq e^{tx/m-1}}
   for any 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        t
        ,
        m
        ∈
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,t,m\in \mathbb {r} }
  .
now, if 
  
    
      
        t
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle t>0}
   and 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        m
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,m\geq 0}
  , this can be rearranged to 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            m
          
        
        ≤
        (
        m
        
          /
        
        (
        t
        e
        )
        
          )

    {\displaystyle x^{m}\leq (m/(te))^{m}e^{tx}}
  .
taking the expectation on both sides gives the bound on 
  
    
      
        e
        [
        
          x

        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle e[x^{m}]}
   in terms of 
  
    
      
        e
        [
        
          e
          
            t
            x
          
        
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle e[e^{tx}]}
  .
as an example, consider 
  
    
      
        x
        ∼
        
          chi-squared
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\sim {\text{chi-squared}}}
   with 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   degrees of freedom. then we know 
  
    
      
        
          m
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        (
        1
        −

        t
        
          )

picking 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        m
        
          /

        +
        k
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=m/(2m+k)}
   and plugging into the bound, we get

  
    
      
        e
        [
        
          x

            2
          
        
        
          e
          
            −
            m

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle e[x^{m}]\leq (1+2m/k)^{k/2}e^{-m}(k+2m)^{m}.}
  we know that in this case the correct bound is 
  
    
      
        e
        [
        
          x

        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}

here the mgf bound is 
  
    
      
        
          k
          
            m

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k^{m}(1+m^{2}/k+o(1/k^{2}))}
  ,
where the real bound is 
  
    
      
        
          k
          
            m
          
        
        (
        1
        +
        (
        
          m
          
            2
          
        
        −
        m
        )
        
          /
        
        k
        +
        o
        (
        1
        
          /
        
        
          k

        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle k^{m}(1+(m^{2}-m)/k+o(1/k^{2}))}
  .
the mgf bound is thus very strong in this case.


== relation to other functions ==
related to the moment-generating function are a number of other transforms that are common in probability theory:

characteristic function
the characteristic function 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{x}(t)}
   is related to the moment-generating function via 
  
    
      
        
          φ
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          m
          
            i
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          m
          
            x
          
        
        (
        i
        t
        )
        :
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi _{x}(t)=m_{ix}(t)=m_{x}(it):}
   the characteristic function is the moment-generating function of ix or the moment generating function of x evaluated on the imaginary axis.  this function can also be viewed as the fourier transform of the probability density function, which can therefore be deduced from it by inverse fourier transform.
cumulant-generating function
the cumulant-generating function is defined as the logarithm of the moment-generating function; some instead define the cumulant-generating function as the logarithm of the characteristic function, while others call this latter the second cumulant-generating function.
probability-generating function
the probability-generating function is defined as 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        z
        )
        =
        e
        
          [
          
            z
            
              x
            
          
          ]
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(z)=e\left[z^{x}\right].\,}
   this immediately implies that 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        
          e
          
            t
          
        
        )
        =
        e
        
          [
          
            e
            
              t
              x
            
          
          ]
        
        =
        
          m
          
            x
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(e^{t})=e\left[e^{tx}\right]=m_{x}(t).\,}
