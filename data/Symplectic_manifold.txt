in differential geometry, a subject of mathematics, a symplectic manifold is a smooth manifold, 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  , equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential 2-form 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  , called the symplectic form. the study of symplectic manifolds is called symplectic geometry or symplectic topology. symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of classical mechanics and analytical mechanics as the cotangent bundles of manifolds. for example, in the hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, which provides one of the major motivations for the field, the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold, and this manifold's cotangent bundle describes the phase space of the system.


== motivation ==
symplectic manifolds arise from classical mechanics; in particular, they are a generalization of the phase space of a closed system. in the same way the hamilton equations allow one to derive the time evolution of a system from a set of differential equations, the symplectic form should allow one to obtain a vector field describing the flow of the system from the differential dh of a hamiltonian function h. so we require a linear map tm → t∗m from the tangent manifold tm to the cotangent manifold t∗m, or equivalently, an element of t∗m ⊗ t∗m. letting ω denote a section of t∗m ⊗ t∗m, the requirement that ω be non-degenerate ensures that for every differential dh there is a unique corresponding vector field vh such that dh = ω(vh, · ). since one desires the hamiltonian to be constant along flow lines, one should have dh(vh) = ω(vh, vh) = 0, which implies that ω is alternating and hence a 2-form. finally, one makes the requirement that ω should not change under flow lines, i.e. that the lie derivative of ω along vh vanishes. applying cartan's formula, this amounts to (here

a symplectic form on a smooth manifold 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a closed non-degenerate differential 2-form 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  . here, non-degenerate means that for every point 
  
    
      
        p
        ∈
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\in m}

        x
        ∈
        
          t

   such that

        (

        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega (x,y)=0}
   for all 
  
    
      
        y

        =

    {\displaystyle x=0}
  . since in odd dimensions, skew-symmetric matrices are always singular, the requirement that 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   be nondegenerate implies that 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   has an even dimension. the closed condition means that the exterior derivative of 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   vanishes. a symplectic manifold is a pair 
  
    
      
        (
        m
        ,
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (m,\omega )}
   where 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a smooth manifold and 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   is a symplectic form. assigning a symplectic form to 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is referred to as giving

   a symplectic structure.

== lagrangian and other submanifolds ==
there are several natural geometric notions of submanifold of a symplectic manifold

   (potentially of any even dimension) are submanifolds 
  
    
      
        s
        ⊂
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle s\subset m}
   such that 
  
    
      
        ω
        
          
            |

   is a symplectic form on 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  .isotropic submanifolds are submanifolds where the symplectic form restricts to zero, i.e. each tangent space is an isotropic subspace of the ambient manifold's tangent space. similarly, if each tangent subspace to a submanifold is co-isotropic (the dual of an isotropic subspace), the submanifold is called co-isotropic.lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold 
  
    
      
        (
        m
        ,
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (m,\omega )}
   are submanifolds where the restriction of the symplectic form

  . lagrangian submanifolds are the maximal isotropic submanifolds.  in physics, lagrangian submanifolds are frequently called branes.one major example is that the graph of a symplectomorphism in the product symplectic manifold (m × m, ω × −ω) is lagrangian. their intersections display rigidity properties not possessed by smooth manifolds; the arnold conjecture gives the sum of the submanifold's betti numbers as a lower bound for the number of self intersections of a smooth lagrangian submanifold, rather than the euler characteristic in the smooth case.

==== example: cotangent bundle ====
the cotangent bundle of a manifold is locally modeled on a space similar to the first example. it can be shown that we can glue these affine symplectic forms hence this bundle forms a symplectic manifold. a less trivial example of a lagrangian submanifold is the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a manifold. for example, let

as local charts on a symplectic manifold take on the canonical form, this example suggests that lagrangian submanifolds are relatively unconstrained. the classification of symplectic manifolds is done via floer homology — this is an application of morse theory to the action functional for maps between lagrangian submanifolds. in physics, the action describes the  time evolution of a physical system; here, it can be taken as the description of the dynamics of branes.


==== example: morse theory ====
another useful class of lagrangian submanifolds occur in morse theory. given a morse function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        m
        →
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:m\to \mathbb {r} }
   and for a small enough 
  
    
      
        ε
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon }
   one can construct a lagrangian submanifold given by the vanishing locus 
  
    
      
        
          v
        
        (
        ε
        ⋅
        
          d
        
        f
        )
        ⊂
        
          t
          
            ∗
          
        
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {v} (\varepsilon \cdot \mathrm {d} f)\subset t^{*}m}
  . for a generic morse function we have a lagrangian intersection given by 
  
    
      
        m
        ∩
        
          v
        
        (
        ε
        ⋅
        
          d
        
        f
        )
        =
        
          crit
        
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\cap \mathbb {v} (\varepsilon \cdot \mathrm {d} f)={\text{crit}}(f)}
  .

  . the following examples are known as special lagrangian submanifolds,

complex lagrangian submanifolds of hyperkahler manifolds,
fixed points of a real structure of calabi–yau manifolds.the syz conjecture deals with the study of special lagrangian submanifolds in mirror symmetry; see (hitchin 1999). 
the thomas–yau conjecture predicts that the existence of a special lagrangian submanifolds on calabi–yau manifolds in hamiltonian isotopy classes of lagrangians is equivalent to stability with respect to a stability condition on the fukaya category of the manifold. 


== lagrangian fibration ==
a lagrangian fibration of a symplectic manifold m is a fibration where all of the fibres are lagrangian submanifolds. since m is even-dimensional we can take local coordinates (p1,…,pn, q1,…,qn), and by darboux's theorem the symplectic form ω can be, at least locally, written as ω = ∑ dpk ∧ dqk, where d denotes the exterior derivative and ∧ denotes the exterior product. this form is called the poincaré two-form or the canonical two-form. using this set-up we can locally think of m as being the cotangent bundle

== lagrangian mapping ==

let l be a lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold (k,ω) given by an immersion i : l ↪ k (i is called a lagrangian immersion). let π : k ↠ b give a lagrangian fibration of k. the composite (π ∘ i) : l ↪ k ↠ b is a lagrangian mapping. the critical value set of π ∘ i is called a caustic.
two lagrangian maps (π1 ∘ i1) : l1 ↪ k1 ↠ b1 and (π2 ∘ i2) : l2 ↪ k2 ↠ b2 are called lagrangian equivalent if there exist diffeomorphisms σ, τ and ν such that both sides of the diagram given on the right commute, and τ preserves the symplectic form. symbolically:
