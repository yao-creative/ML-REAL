in mathematical logic, formation rules are rules for describing which strings of symbols formed from the alphabet of a formal language are syntactically valid within the language. these rules only address the location and manipulation of the strings of the language. it does not describe anything else about a language, such as its semantics (i.e. what the strings mean). (see also formal grammar).


== formal language ==

a formal language is an organized set of symbols the essential feature being that it can be precisely defined in terms of just the shapes and locations of those symbols. such a language can be defined, then, without any reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it—that is, before it has any meaning. a formal grammar determines which symbols and sets of symbols are formulas in a formal language.


== formal systems ==

a formal system (also called a logical calculus, or a logical system) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a deductive system). the deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called inference rules) or a set of axioms, or have both. a formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. propositional and predicate calculi are examples of formal systems.


== propositional and predicate logic ==
the formation rules of a propositional calculus may, for instance, take a form such that;

if we take φ to be a propositional formula we can also take 
  
    
      
        ¬
      
    
    {\displaystyle \neg }
  φ to be a formula;
if we take φ and ψ to be a propositional formulas we can also take (φ 
  
    
      
        ∧
      
    
    {\displaystyle \wedge }
    ψ), (φ 
  
    
      
        →
      
    
    {\displaystyle \to }
    ψ), (φ 
  
    
      
        ∨
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lor }
    ψ) and (φ 
  
    
      
        ↔
      
    
    {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow }
    ψ) to also be formulas.a predicate calculus will usually include all the same rules as a propositional calculus, with the addition of quantifiers such that if we take φ to be a formula of propositional logic and α as a variable then we can take (
  
    
      
        ∀
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall }
  α)φ and (
  
    
      
        ∃
      
    
    {\displaystyle \exists }
  α)φ each to be formulas of our predicate calculus.
