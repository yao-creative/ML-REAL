in mathematics, specifically in the calculus of variations, a variation δf of a function f can be concentrated on an arbitrarily small interval, but not a single point.
accordingly, the necessary condition of extremum (functional derivative equal zero) appears in a weak formulation (variational form) integrated with an arbitrary function δf. the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations is typically used to transform this weak formulation into the strong formulation (differential equation), free of the integration with arbitrary function. the proof usually exploits the possibility to choose δf concentrated on an interval on which f keeps sign (positive or negative). several versions of the lemma are in use. basic versions are easy to formulate and prove. more powerful versions are used when needed.

here is the special case for f = 0 (often sufficient).

== versions for discontinuous functions ==
the given functions (f, g) may be discontinuous, provided that they are locally integrable (on the given interval). in this case, lebesgue integration is meant, the conclusions hold almost everywhere (thus, in all continuity points), and differentiability of g is interpreted as local absolute continuity (rather than continuous differentiability). sometimes the given functions are assumed to be piecewise continuous, in which case riemann integration suffices, and the conclusions are stated everywhere except the finite set of discontinuity points.

== vector-valued functions ==
generalization to vector-valued functions 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        )
        →
        
          
            r
          
          
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a,b)\to \mathbb {r} ^{d}}
   is straightforward; one applies the results for scalar functions to each coordinate separately, or treats the vector-valued case from the beginning.


== multivariable functions ==
if a continuous multivariable function f on an open set 
  
    
      
        ω
        ⊂
        
          
            r
          
          
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega \subset \mathbb {r} ^{d}}
   satisfies the equality

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            ω
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
        h
        (
        x
        )
        
        
          d
        
        x
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{\omega }f(x)\,h(x)\,\mathrm {d} x=0}
  
for all compactly supported smooth functions h on ω, then f is identically zero.similarly to the basic version, one may consider a continuous function f on the closure of ω, assuming that h vanishes on the boundary of ω (rather than compactly supported).here is a version for discontinuous multivariable functions.

let 
  
    
      
        ω
        ⊂
        
          
            r
          
          
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega \subset \mathbb {r} ^{d}}
   be an open set, and 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        
          l
          
            2
          
        
        (
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\in l^{2}(\omega )}
   satisfy the equality

  
    
      
        
          ∫
          
            ω
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
        h
        (
        x
        )
        
        
          d
        
        x
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int _{\omega }f(x)\,h(x)\,\mathrm {d} x=0}
  
for all compactly supported smooth functions h on ω. then f=0 (in l2, that is, almost everywhere).
