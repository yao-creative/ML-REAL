in mathematics, hausdorff measure is a generalization of the traditional notions of area and volume to non-integer dimensions, specifically fractals and their hausdorff dimensions. it is a type of outer measure, named for felix hausdorff, that assigns a number in [0,∞] to each set in 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   or, more generally, in any metric space.
the zero-dimensional hausdorff measure is the number of points in the set (if the set is finite) or ∞ if the set is infinite. likewise, the one-dimensional hausdorff measure of a simple curve in 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   is equal to the length of the curve, and the two-dimensional hausdorff measure of a lebesgue-measurable subset of 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{2}}
   is proportional to the area of the set. thus, the concept of the hausdorff measure generalizes the lebesgue measure and its notions of counting, length, and area. it also generalizes volume. in fact, there are d-dimensional hausdorff measures for any d ≥ 0, which is not necessarily an integer. these measures are fundamental in geometric measure theory. they appear naturally in  harmonic analysis or potential theory.

    {\displaystyle h^{d}(s)}
   is an outer measure (more precisely, it is a metric outer measure). by carathéodory's extension theorem, its restriction to the σ-field of carathéodory-measurable sets is a measure. it is called the 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  -dimensional hausdorff measure of 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  . due to the metric outer measure property, all borel subsets of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   are

            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{d}}
   measurable.
in the above definition the sets in the covering are arbitrary. however, we can require the covering sets to be open or closed, or  in normed spaces even convex, that will yield the same 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            δ

        (
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{\delta }^{d}(s)}
   numbers, hence the same measure. in 
  
    
      
        
          
            r
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} ^{n}}
   restricting the covering sets to be balls may change the measures but does not change the dimension of the measured sets.

  remark. some authors adopt a definition of hausdorff measure slightly different from the one chosen here, the difference being that the value

            d
          
        
        (
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{d}(e)}
   defined above is multiplied by the factor 
  
    
      
        
          2
          
            −
            d
          
        
        
          α
          
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{-d}\alpha _{d}}
  , so that hausdorff d-dimensional measure coincides exactly with lebesgue measure in the case of euclidean space.


== relation with hausdorff dimension ==

it turns out that 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            d
          
        
        (
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{d}(s)}
   may have a finite, nonzero value for at most one 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  . that is, the hausdorff measure is zero for any value above a certain dimension and infinity below a certain dimension, analogous to the idea that the area of a line is zero and the length of a 2d shape is in some sense infinity. this leads to one of several possible equivalent definitions of the hausdorff dimension:

  
    
      
        
          dim

note that it is not guaranteed that the hausdorff measure must be finite and nonzero for some d, and indeed the measure at the hausdorff dimension may still be zero; in this case, the hausdorff dimension still acts as a change point between measures of zero and infinity.

in geometric measure theory and related fields, the minkowski content is often used to measure the size of a subset of a metric measure space. for suitable domains in euclidean space, the two notions of size coincide, up to overall normalizations depending on conventions. more precisely, a subset of

   is said to be 
  
    
      
        m

in fractal geometry, some fractals with hausdorff dimension

  -dimensional hausdorff measure. for example, almost surely the image of planar brownian motion has hausdorff dimension 2 and its two-dimensional hausdorff measure is zero. in order to "measure" the "size" of such sets, the following variation on the notion of the hausdorff measure can be considered:
