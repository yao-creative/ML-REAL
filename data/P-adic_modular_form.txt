in mathematics, a p-adic modular form is a p-adic analog of a modular form, with coefficients that are p-adic numbers rather than complex numbers. serre (1973) introduced p-adic modular forms as limits of ordinary modular forms, and katz (1973) shortly afterwards gave a geometric and more general definition. katz's p-adic modular forms include as special cases classical p-adic modular forms, which are more or less p-adic linear combinations of the usual "classical" modular forms, and overconvergent p-adic modular forms, which in turn include hida's ordinary modular forms as special cases.


== serre's definition ==
serre defined a p-adic modular form to be a formal power series with p-adic coefficients that is a p-adic limit of classical modular forms with integer coefficients. the weights of these classical modular forms need not be the same; in fact, if they are then the p-adic modular form is nothing more than a linear combination of classical modular forms. in general the weight of a p-adic modular form is a p-adic number, given by the limit of the weights of the classical modular forms (in fact a slight refinement gives a weight in zp×z/(p–1)z).
the p-adic modular forms defined by serre are special cases of those defined by katz.


== katz's definition ==
a classical modular form of weight k can be thought of roughly as a function f from pairs (e,ω) of a complex elliptic curve with a holomorphic 1-form ω to complex numbers, such that f(e,λω) = λ−kf(e,ω), and satisfying some additional conditions such as being holomorphic in some sense.
katz's definition of a p-adic modular form is similar, except that e is now an elliptic curve over some algebra r (with p nilpotent) over the ring of integers r0 of a finite extension of the p-adic numbers, such that e is not supersingular, in the sense that the eisenstein series ep–1 is invertible at (e,ω). the p-adic modular form f now takes values in r rather than in the complex numbers. the p-adic modular form also has to satisfy some other conditions analogous to the condition that a classical modular form should be holomorphic.


== overconvergent forms ==

overconvergent p-adic modular forms are similar to the modular forms defined by katz, except that the form has to be defined on a larger collection of elliptic curves. roughly speaking, the value of the eisenstein series ek–1 on the form is no longer required to be invertible, but can be a smaller element of r. informally the series for the modular form converges on this larger collection of elliptic curves, hence the name "overconvergent".
