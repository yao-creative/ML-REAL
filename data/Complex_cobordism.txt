in mathematics, complex cobordism is a generalized cohomology theory related to cobordism of manifolds. its spectrum is denoted by mu. it is an exceptionally powerful cohomology theory, but can be quite hard to compute, so often instead of using it directly one uses some slightly weaker theories derived from it, such as brown–peterson cohomology or morava k-theory, that are easier to compute.
the generalized homology and cohomology complex cobordism theories were introduced by michael atiyah (1961) using the thom spectrum.

complex cobordism has a natural complex orientation. daniel quillen (1969) showed that there is a natural isomorphism from its coefficient ring to lazard's universal ring, making the formal group law of complex cobordism into the universal formal group law. in other words, for any formal group law f over any commutative ring r, there is a unique ring homomorphism from mu*(point) to r such that f is the pullback of the formal group law of complex cobordism.


== brown–peterson cohomology ==
complex cobordism over the rationals can be reduced to ordinary cohomology over the rationals, so the main interest is in the torsion of complex cobordism. it is often easier to study the torsion one prime at a time by localizing mu at a prime p; roughly speaking this means one kills off torsion prime to p. the localization mup of mu at a prime p splits as a sum of suspensions of a simpler cohomology theory called brown–peterson cohomology, first described by brown & peterson (1966). in practice one often does calculations with brown–peterson cohomology rather than with complex cobordism. knowledge of the brown–peterson cohomologies of a space for all primes p is roughly equivalent to knowledge of its complex cobordism.

the hopf algebra mu*(mu) is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra r[b1, b2, ...], where r is the reduced bordism ring of a 0-sphere.
