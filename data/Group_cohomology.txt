in mathematics (more specifically, in homological algebra), group cohomology is a set of mathematical tools used to study groups using cohomology theory, a technique from algebraic topology. analogous to group representations, group cohomology looks at the group actions of a group g in an associated g-module m to elucidate the properties of the group. by treating the g-module as a kind of topological space with elements of 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{n}}
   representing n-simplices, topological properties of the space may be computed, such as the set of cohomology groups 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            n
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{n}(g,m)}
  . the cohomology groups in turn provide insight into the structure of the group g and g-module m themselves. group cohomology plays a role in the investigation of fixed points of a group action in a module or space and the quotient module or space with respect to a group action. group cohomology is used in the fields of abstract algebra, homological algebra, algebraic topology and algebraic number theory, as well as in applications to group theory proper. as in algebraic topology, there is a dual theory called group homology. the techniques of group cohomology can also be extended to the case that instead of a g-module, g acts on a nonabelian g-group; in effect, a generalization of a module to non-abelian coefficients.
these algebraic ideas are closely related to topological ideas. the group cohomology of a discrete group g is the singular cohomology of a suitable space having g as its fundamental group, namely the corresponding eilenberg–maclane space. thus, the group cohomology of 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} }
   can be thought of as the singular cohomology of the circle s1, and similarly for 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
        
          /

          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} /2\mathbb {z} }
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        (
        
          r
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {p} ^{\infty }(\mathbb {r} ).}
  
a great deal is known about the cohomology of groups, including interpretations of low-dimensional cohomology, functoriality, and how to change groups. the subject of group cohomology began in the 1920s, matured in the late 1940s, and continues as an area of active research today.


== motivation ==
a general paradigm in group theory is that a group g should be studied via its group representations. a slight generalization of those representations are the g-modules: a g-module is an abelian group m together with a group action of g on m, with every element of g acting as an automorphism of m. we will write g multiplicatively and m additively.
given such a g-module m, it is natural to consider the submodule of g-invariant elements:

  
    
      
        
          m
          
            g
          
        
        =
        {
        x
        ∈
        m
         
        
          |
        
         
        ∀
        g
        ∈
        g
        :
         
        g
        x
        =
        x
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m^{g}=\lbrace x\in m\ |\ \forall g\in g:\ gx=x\rbrace .}
  now, if n is a g-submodule of m (i.e., a subgroup of m mapped to itself by the action of g), it isn't in general true that the invariants in 
  
    
      
        m
        
          /
        
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle m/n}
   are found as the quotient of the invariants in m by those in n: being invariant 'modulo n ' is broader. the purpose of the first group cohomology 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            1
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{1}(g,n)}
   is to precisely measure this difference.

    {\displaystyle h^{*}}
   in general measure the extent to which taking invariants doesn't respect exact sequences. this is expressed by a long exact sequence.


== definitions ==
the collection of all g-modules is a category (the morphisms are group homomorphisms f with the property 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        g
        x
        )
        =
        g
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(gx)=g(f(x))}
   for all g in g and x in m). sending each module m to the group of invariants

            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle m^{g}}
   yields a functor from the category of g-modules to the category ab of abelian groups. this functor is left exact but not necessarily right exact. we may therefore form its right derived functors. their values are abelian groups and they are denoted by

            n
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{n}(g,m)}
  , "the n-th cohomology group of g with coefficients in m". furthermore, the group 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            0
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        m
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{0}(g,m)}
   may be identified with 
  
    
      
        
          m
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle m^{g}}
  .

=== the functors extn and formal definition of group cohomology ===
interpreting g-modules as modules over the group ring 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
        [
        g
        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} [g],}
   one can note that

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            0

        g
        ,
        m
        )
        =
        
          m
          
            g
          
        
        =
        
          hom
          
            
              z
            
            [
            g
            ]
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        
          z
        
        ,
        m
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{0}(g,m)=m^{g}=\operatorname {hom} _{\mathbb {z} [g]}(\mathbb {z} ,m),}
  i.e., the subgroup of g-invariant elements in m is identified with the group of homomorphisms from 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} }
  , which is treated as the trivial g-module (every element of g acts as the identity) to m.
therefore, as ext functors are the derived functors of hom, there is a natural isomorphism

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            n
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        m
        )
        =
        
          ext
          
            
              z
            
            [
            g
            ]
          
          
            n
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        
          z
        
        ,
        m
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{n}(g,m)=\operatorname {ext} _{\mathbb {z} [g]}^{n}(\mathbb {z} ,m).}
  these ext groups can also be computed via a projective resolution of 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} }
  , the advantage being that such a resolution only depends on g and not on m. we recall the definition of ext more explicitly for this context. let f be a projective

== group homology ==
dually to the construction of group cohomology there is the following definition of group homology: given a g-module m, set dm to be the submodule generated by elements of the form g·m − m, g ∈ g, m ∈ m. assigning to m its so-called coinvariants, the quotient

  
    
      
        
          m

        :=
        m
        
          /
        
        d
        m
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{g}:=m/dm,}
  is a right exact functor. its left derived functors are by definition the group homology

  
    
      
        
          h

        m
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{n}(g,m).}
  the covariant functor which assigns mg to m is isomorphic to the functor which sends m to

the first cohomology group is the quotient of the so-called crossed homomorphisms, i.e. maps (of sets) f : g → m satisfying f(ab) = f(a) + af(b) for all a, b in g, modulo the so-called principal crossed homomorphisms, i.e. maps f : g → m given by f(a) = am−m for some fixed m ∈ m. this follows from the definition of cochains above.
if the action of g on m is trivial, then the above boils down to h1(g,m) = hom(g, m), the group of group homomorphisms g → m.

=== functoriality ===
group cohomology depends contravariantly on the group g, in the following sense: if f : h → g is a group homomorphism, then we have a naturally induced morphism hn(g, m) → hn(h, m) (where in the latter, m is treated as an h-module via f). this map is called the restriction map. if the index of h in g is finite, there is also a map in the opposite direction, called transfer map,

  
    
      
        c
        o
        
          r

            g
          
        
        :
        
          h
          
            n
          
        
        (
        h
        ,
        m

        (
        g
        ,
        m
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle cor_{h}^{g}:h^{n}(h,m)\to h^{n}(g,m).}
  in degree 0, it is given by the map

  
    
      
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  
                    m
                    
                      h
                    
                  
                  →
                  
                    m
                    
                      g
                    
                  
                
              
              
                
                  m
                  ↦
                  
                    ∑
                    
                      g
                      ∈
                      g
                      
                        /
                      
                      h
                    
                  
                  g
                  m
                
              
            
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}m^{h}\to m^{g}\\m\mapsto \sum _{g\in g/h}gm\end{cases}}}
  given a morphism of g-modules m → n, one gets a morphism of cohomology groups in the hn(g, m) → hn(g, n).


=== products ===
similarly to other cohomology theories in topology and geometry, such as singular cohomology or de rham cohomology, group cohomology enjoys a product structure: there is a natural map called cup product:

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            n
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        n
        )
        ⊗
        
          h
          
            m
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        m
        )
        →
        
          h
          
            n
            +
            m
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        m
        ⊗
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{n}(g,n)\otimes h^{m}(g,m)\to h^{n+m}(g,m\otimes n)}
  for any two g-modules m and n. this yields a graded anti-commutative ring structure on 
  
    
      
        
          ⊕
          
            n
            ⩾
            0
          
        
        
          h
          
            n
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        r
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \oplus _{n\geqslant 0}h^{n}(g,r),}
   where r is a ring such as 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} }
   or 
  
    
      
        
          z
        
        
          /
        
        p
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} /p.}
   for a finite group g, the even part of this cohomology ring in characteristic p, 
  
    
      
        
          ⊕
          
            n
            ⩾
            0

        ,
        
          z
        
        
          /
        
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \oplus _{n\geqslant 0}h^{2n}(g,\mathbb {z} /p)}
   carries a lot of information about the group the structure of g, for example the krull dimension of this ring equals the maximal rank of an abelian subgroup 
  
    
      
        (
        
          z
        
        
          /
        
        p
        
          )
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\mathbb {z} /p)^{r}}
  .for example, let g be the group with two elements, under the discrete topology. the real projective space 
  
    
      
        
          
            p
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        (
        
          r
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {p} ^{\infty }(\mathbb {r} )}
   is a classifying space for g. let 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        
          
            f
          
          
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=\mathbb {f} _{2},}
   the field of two elements. then

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            ∗

        x
        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{*}(g;k)\cong k[x],}
  a polynomial k-algebra on a single generator, since this is the cellular cohomology ring of 
  
    
      
        
          
            p

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {p} ^{\infty }(\mathbb {r} ).}
  


=== künneth formula ===
if, m = k is a field, then h*(g; k) is a graded k-algebra and the cohomology of a product of groups is related to the ones of the individual groups by a künneth formula:

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ×
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
        ;
        k
        )
        ≅
        
          h
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        
          g
          
            1
          
        
        ;
        k
        )
        ⊗
        
          h
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        
          g
          
            2
          
        
        ;
        k
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{*}(g_{1}\times g_{2};k)\cong h^{*}(g_{1};k)\otimes h^{*}(g_{2};k).}
  for example, if g is an elementary abelian 2-group of rank r, and 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        
          
            f
          
          
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=\mathbb {f} _{2},}
   then the künneth formula shows that the cohomology of g is a polynomial k-algebra generated by r classes in h1(g; k).,

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            ∗
          
        
        (
        g
        ;
        k
        )
        ≅
        k
        [
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          x
          
            r
          
        
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{*}(g;k)\cong k[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{r}].}
  


=== homology vs. cohomology ===
as for other cohomology theories, such as singular cohomology, group cohomology and homology are related to one another by means of a short exact sequence

=== change of group ===
the hochschild–serre spectral sequence relates the cohomology of a normal subgroup n of g and the quotient g/n to the cohomology of the group g (for (pro-)finite groups g). from it, one gets the inflation-restriction exact sequence.

group cohomology is closely related to topological cohomology theories such as sheaf cohomology, by means of an isomorphism

=== higher cohomology groups are torsion ===
the cohomology groups hn(g, m) of finite groups g are all torsion for all n≥1. indeed, by maschke's theorem the category of representations of a finite group is semi-simple over any field of characteristic zero (or more generally, any field whose characteristic does not divide the order of the group), hence, viewing group cohomology as a derived functor in this abelian category, one obtains that it is zero. the other argument is that over a field of characteristic zero, the group algebra of a finite group is a direct sum of matrix algebras (possibly over division algebras which are extensions of the original field), while a matrix algebra is morita equivalent to its base field and hence has trivial cohomology.
if the order of g is invertible in a g-module m (for example, if m is a 
  
    
      
        
          q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {q} }
  -vector space), the transfer map can be used to show that 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            n
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        m
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{n}(g,m)=0}
   for 
  
    
      
        n
        ⩾
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geqslant 1.}
   a typical application of this fact is as follows: the long exact cohomology sequence of the short exact sequence (where all three groups have a trivial g-action)

  
    
      
        0
        →
        
          z

          z

    {\displaystyle 0\to \mathbb {z} \to \mathbb {q} \to \mathbb {q} /\mathbb {z} \to 0}
  yields an isomorphism

  tate cohomology enjoys similar features, such as long exact sequences, product structures. an important application is in class field theory, see class formation.

        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {z} /n\rtimes \mathbb {z} /m}
   has this property for coprime integers n and m.

   note that if we allow the phases themselves to be acted on by the group (for example, time reversal would complex-conjugate the phase), then the first term in each of the coboundary operations will have a

=== cohomology of topological groups ===
given a topological group g, i.e., a group equipped with a topology such that product and inverse are continuous maps, it is natural to consider continuous g-modules, i.e., requiring that the action

  
    
      
        g
        ×
        m
        →
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\times m\to m}
  is a continuous map. for such modules, one can again consider the derived functor of 
  
    
      
        m
        ↦
        
          m
          
            g
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\mapsto m^{g}}
  . a special case occurring in algebra and number theory is when g is profinite, for example the absolute galois group of a field. the resulting cohomology is called galois cohomology.


=== non-abelian group cohomology ===

using the g-invariants and the 1-cochains, one can construct the zeroth and first group cohomology for a group g with coefficients in a non-abelian group. specifically, a g-group is a (not necessarily abelian) group a together with an action by g.
the zeroth cohomology of g with coefficients in a is defined to be the subgroup

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            0
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        a
        )
        =
        
          a
          
            g
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{0}(g,a)=a^{g},}
  of elements of a fixed by g.
the first cohomology of g with coefficients in a is defined as 1-cocycles modulo an equivalence relation instead of by 1-coboundaries. the condition for a map 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   to be a 1-cocycle is that 
  
    
      
        φ
        (
        g
        h
        )
        =
        φ
        (
        g
        )
        [
        g
        φ
        (
        h
        )
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi (gh)=\varphi (g)[g\varphi (h)]}
   and 
  
    
      
         
        φ

== history and relation to other fields ==
the low-dimensional cohomology of a group was classically studied in other guises, well before the notion of group cohomology was formulated in 1943–45. the first theorem of the subject can be identified as hilbert's theorem 90 in 1897; this was recast into emmy noether's equations in galois theory (an appearance of cocycles for 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{1}}
  ). the idea of factor sets for the extension problem for groups (connected with  
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{2}}
  ) arose in the work of otto hölder (1893), in issai schur's 1904 study of projective representations, in otto schreier's 1926 treatment, and in richard brauer's 1928 study of simple algebras and the brauer group. a fuller discussion of this history may be found in (weibel 1999, pp. 806–811).
in 1941, while studying 
  
    
      
        
          h
          
            2
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        
          z
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h^{2}(g,\mathbb {z} )}
   (which plays a special role in groups), heinz hopf discovered what is now called hopf's integral homology formula (hopf 1942), which is identical to schur's formula for the schur multiplier of a finite, finitely presented group:

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            2
          
        
        (
        g
        ,
        
          z
        
        )
        ≅
        (
        r
        ∩
        [
        f
        ,
        f
        ]
        )
        
          /
        
        [
        f
        ,
        r
        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{2}(g,\mathbb {z} )\cong (r\cap [f,f])/[f,r],}
  where 
  
    
      
        g
        ≅
        f
        
          /
        
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\cong f/r}
   and f is a free group.
hopf's result led to the independent discovery of group cohomology by several groups in 1943-45: samuel eilenberg and saunders mac lane in the united states (rotman 1995, p. 358); hopf and beno eckmann in switzerland;  hans freudenthal in the netherlands (weibel 1999, p. 807); and dmitry faddeev in the soviet union (arslanov 2011, p. 29, faddeev 1947). the situation was chaotic because communication between these countries was difficult during world war ii.
from a topological point of view, the homology and cohomology of g was first defined as the homology and cohomology of a model for the topological classifying space bg as discussed above. in practice, this meant using topology to produce the chain complexes used in formal algebraic definitions. from a module-theoretic point of view this was integrated into the cartan–eilenberg theory of homological algebra in the early 1950s.
the application in algebraic number theory to class field theory provided theorems valid for general galois extensions (not just abelian extensions). the cohomological part of class field theory was axiomatized as the theory of class formations. in turn, this led to the notion of galois cohomology and étale cohomology (which builds on it) (weibel 1999, p. 822). some refinements in the theory post-1960 have been made, such as continuous cocycles and john tate's redefinition, but the basic outlines remain the same. this is a large field, and now basic in the theories of algebraic groups.
the analogous theory for lie algebras, called lie algebra cohomology, was first developed in the late 1940s, by claude chevalley and eilenberg, and jean-louis koszul (weibel 1999, p. 810). it is formally similar, using the corresponding definition of invariant for the action of a lie algebra. it is much applied in representation theory, and is closely connected with the brst quantization of theoretical physics.
group cohomology theory also has a direct application in condensed matter physics. just like group theory being the mathematical foundation of spontaneous symmetry breaking phases, group cohomology theory is the mathematical foundation of a class of quantum states of matter—short-range entangled states with symmetry. short-range entangled states with symmetry are also known as symmetry-protected topological states.
