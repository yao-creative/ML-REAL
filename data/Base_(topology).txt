in mathematics, a base (or basis) for the topology τ of a topological space (x, τ) is a family 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   of open subsets of x such that every open set of the topology is equal to the union of some sub-family of 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
  .  for example, the set of all open intervals in the real number line 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   is a basis for the euclidean topology on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   because every open interval is an open set, and also every open subset of 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   can be written as a union of some family of open intervals. 
bases are ubiquitous throughout topology. the sets in a base for a topology, which are called basic open sets, are often easier to describe and use than arbitrary open sets. many important topological definitions such as continuity and convergence can be checked using only basic open sets instead of arbitrary open sets. some topologies have a base of open sets with specific useful properties that may make checking such topological definitions easier. 
not all families of subsets of a set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   form a base for a topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . under some conditions detailed below, a family of subsets will form a base for a (unique) topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  , obtained by taking all possibly unions of subfamilies.  such families of sets are very frequently used to define topologies. a weaker notion related to bases is that of a subbase for a topology.  bases for topologies are also closely related to neighborhood bases.

for example, the collection of all open intervals in the real line forms a base for the standard topology on the real numbers.  more generally, in a metric space 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   the collection of all open balls about points of 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   forms a base for the topology.
in general, a topological space 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        τ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,\tau )}
   can have many bases.  the whole topology 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   is always a base for itself (that is, 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   is a base for 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
  ).  for the real line, the collection of all open intervals is a base for the topology.  so is the collection of all open intervals with rational endpoints, or the collection of all open intervals with irrational endpoints, for example.  note that two different bases need not have any basic open set in common.  one of the topological properties of a space 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology, called the weight of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and denoted 
  
    
      
        w
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle w(x)}
  .  from the examples above, the real line has countable weight.

        x

conversely, suppose 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is just a set without any topology and 
  
    
      
        
          
            b

            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   is a base for the topology that it generates.  more precisely, let 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   be the family of all subsets of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   that are unions of subfamilies of 
  
    
      
        
          
            b

  .  then 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   is a topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and

  .
(sketch: 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   defines a topology because it is stable under arbitrary unions by construction, it is stable under finite intersections by (b2), it contains 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   by (b1), and it contains the empty set as the union of the empty subfamily of 
  
    
      
        
          
            b

  .  the family 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   is then a base for 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   by construction.)  such families of sets are a very common way of defining a topology.
in general, if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a set and 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   is an arbitrary collection of subsets of 
  
    
      
        x

        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   is called the topology generated by 
  
    
      
        
          
            b

        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   can also be characterized as the set of all arbitrary unions of finite intersections of elements of 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
  . (see the article about subbase.) now, if 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   also satisfies properties (b1) and (b2), the topology generated by 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   can be described in a simpler way without having to take intersections: 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   is the set of all unions of elements of 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   (and 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   is base for 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   in that case).
there is often a easy way to check condition (b2).  if the intersection of any two elements of 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   is itself an element of 
  
    
      
        
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {b}}}
   or is empty, then condition (b2) is automatically satisfied (by taking 
  
    
      
        
          b
          
            3
          
        
        =
        
          b
          
            1
          
        
        ∩
        
          b
          
            2

  ).  for example, the euclidean topology on the plane admits as a base the set of all open rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides, and a nonempty intersection of two such basic open sets is also a basic open set.  but another base for the same topology is the collection of all open disks; and here the full (b2) condition is necessary.
an example of a collection of open sets that is not a base is the set 
  
    
      
        s

          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in \mathbb {r} }
  .  the topology generated by 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   contains all open intervals

  , hence 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}

        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   is only a subbase for the topology, not a base: a finite open interval 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a,b)}
   does not contain any element of 
  
    
      
        s

a non-empty family of subsets of a set x that is closed under finite intersections of two or more sets, which is called a π-system on x, is necessarily a base for a topology on x if and only if it covers x.  by definition, every σ-algebra, every filter (and so in particular, every neighborhood filter), and every topology is a covering π-system and so also a base for a topology.  in fact, if γ is a filter on x then { ∅ } ∪ γ is a topology on x and γ is a basis for it.  a base for a topology does not have to be closed under finite intersections and many aren't.  but nevertheless, many topologies are defined by bases that are also closed under finite intersections.  for example, each of the following families of subset of 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   is closed under finite intersections and so each forms a basis for some< topology on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  :

the set γ of all bounded open intervals in 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   generates the usual euclidean topology on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  .
the set σ of all bounded closed intervals in 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   generates the discrete topology on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   and so the euclidean topology is a subset of this topology. this is despite the fact that γ is not a subset σ. consequently, the topology generated by γ, which is the euclidean topology on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  , is coarser than the topology generated by σ. in fact, it is strictly coarser because σ contains non-empty compact sets which are never open in the euclidean topology.
the set γ
  
    
      
        
          q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {q} }
   of all intervals in γ such that both endpoints of the interval are rational numbers generates the same topology as γ. this remains true if each instance of the symbol γ is replaced by σ.
σ∞ = { [r, ∞) : r ∈ 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   } generates a topology that is strictly coarser than the topology generated by σ. no element of σ∞ is open in the euclidean topology on 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
  .
γ∞ = { (r, ∞) : r ∈ 
  
    
      
        
          r
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {r} }
   } generates a topology that is strictly coarser than both the euclidean topology and the topology generated by σ∞. the sets σ∞ and γ∞ are disjoint, but nevertheless γ∞ is a subset of the topology generated by σ∞.


=== objects defined in terms of bases ===
the order topology on a totally ordered set admits a collection of open-interval-like sets as a base.
in a metric space the collection of all open balls forms a base for the topology.
the discrete topology has the collection of all singletons as a base.
a second-countable space is one that has a countable base.the zariski topology on the spectrum of a ring has a base consisting of open sets that have specific useful properties. for the usual base for this topology, every finite intersection of basic open sets is a basic open set.

   and not containing 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  ).any collection of subsets of a set 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   satisfying these properties forms a base for the closed sets of a topology on 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   the closed sets of this topology are precisely the intersections of members of 
  
    
      
        
          
            c
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {c}}.}
  
in some cases it is more convenient to use a base for the closed sets rather than the open ones. for example, a space is completely regular if and only if the zero sets form a base for the closed sets. given any topological space 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   the zero sets form the base for the closed sets of some topology on 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   this topology will be the finest completely regular topology on 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   coarser than the original one. in a similar vein, the zariski topology on an is defined by taking the zero sets of polynomial functions as a base for the closed sets.


== weight and character ==
we shall work with notions established in (engelking 1977, p. 12, pp. 127-128).
fix x a topological space. here, a network is a family 
  
    
      
        
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {n}}}
   of sets, for which, for all points x and open neighbourhoods u containing x, there exists b in 
  
    
      
        
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {n}}}
   for which 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        b
        ⊆
        u
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in b\subseteq u.}
   note that, unlike a basis, the sets in a network need not be open.
we define the weight, w(x), as the minimum cardinality of a basis; we define the network weight, nw(x), as the minimum cardinality of a network; the character of a point, 
  
    
      
        χ
        (
        x
        ,
        x
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi (x,x),}
   as the minimum cardinality of a neighbourhood basis for x in x; and the character of x to be

the point of computing the character and weight is to be able to tell what sort of bases and local bases can exist. we have the following facts:

nw(x) ≤ w(x).
if x is discrete, then w(x) = nw(x) = |x|.
if x is hausdorff, then nw(x) is finite if and only if x is finite discrete.
if b is a basis of x then there is a basis 
  
    
      
        
          b
          ′
        
        ⊆
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b'\subseteq b}
   of size 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          b
          ′
        
        
          |
        
        ≤
        w
        (
        x
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle |b'|\leq w(x).}
  
if n a neighbourhood basis for x in x then there is a neighbourhood basis 
  
    
      
        
          n
          ′
        
        ⊆

          ′
        
        
          |
        
        ≤
        χ
        (
        x
        ,
        x
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle |n'|\leq \chi (x,x).}
  
if 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:x\to y}
   is a continuous surjection, then nw(y) ≤ w(x). (simply consider the y-network

          ‴

    {\displaystyle f'''b\triangleq \{f''u:u\in b\}}
   for each basis b of x.)
if 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        τ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,\tau )}
   is hausdorff, then there exists a weaker hausdorff topology 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        
          τ
          ′
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,\tau ')}
   so that 
  
    
      
        w
        (
        x
        ,
        
          τ
          ′

        ≤
        n
        w
        (
        x

        τ
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle w(x,\tau ')\leq nw(x,\tau ).}
   so a fortiori, if x is also compact, then such topologies coincide and hence we have, combined with the first fact, nw(x) = w(x).
if 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        x
        →
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:x\to y}
   a continuous surjective map from a compact metrisable space to an hausdorff space, then y is compact metrisable.the last fact follows from f(x) being compact hausdorff, and hence 
  
    
      
        n
        w
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        w
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        ≤
        w
        (
        x
        )
        ≤
        
          ℵ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle nw(f(x))=w(f(x))\leq w(x)\leq \aleph _{0}}
   (since compact metrisable spaces are necessarily second countable); as well as the fact that compact hausdorff spaces are metrisable exactly in case they are second countable. (an application of this, for instance, is that every path in an hausdorff space is compact metrisable.)


=== increasing chains of open sets ===
using the above notation, suppose that w(x) ≤ κ some infinite cardinal. then there does not exist a strictly increasing sequence of open sets (equivalently strictly decreasing sequence of closed sets) of length ≥ κ+.
to see this (without the axiom of choice), fix

as a basis of open sets. and suppose per contra, that

were a strictly increasing sequence of open sets. this means

for

we may use the basis to find some uγ with x in uγ ⊆ vα. in this way we may well-define a map, f : κ+ → κ mapping each α to the least γ for which uγ ⊆ vα and meets

this map is injective, otherwise there would be α < β with f(α) = f(β) = γ, which would further imply uγ ⊆ vα but also meets

which is a contradiction. but this would go to show that κ+ ≤ κ, a contradiction.
